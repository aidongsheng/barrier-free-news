active in recent years, likely emboldened by the mainstream
electoral success of far-right parties, as well as increased
perceived grievances associated with the migrant crisis and recent
Islamist militant attacks in Europe.</p><p>While the predominant terrorism threat in Western Europe still
comes from militant Islamist actors, far-right extremists pose a
potentially increasingly significant threat to a smaller target set
- namely religious and ethnic minorities, individuals and groups
with opposing political views and people identifying as LGBT+.</p><p>From a counter-terrorism perspective, the increase in far-right
extremism has likely put further pressure on limited
counter-terrorism policing and judicial resources already
attempting to contain and prosecute the militant Islamist threat.
Counter-terrorism operations related to right-wing extremist
activity or hate crimes have increased significantly. In 2015 and
2016, 22 operations were recorded in total in western Europe.
Between 2017 and 2018, this increased to 64.</p><p>In response to increased right-wing extremist activity, as well
as the election of far-right governments or representatives in
certain European countries, retaliatory counter violence can also
be expected from left-wing extremists. This is particularly likely
in countries with existing established left-wing extremist activity
such as Germany, Italy, and Greece. These are likely to
predominantly take the form of arson or low level IED attacks
targeting assets associated with right-wing extremist groups or
individuals as well as violent counter-protests against any marches
conducted by these groups.</p><p>Proportion of UK right wing extremist terror arrests
triple in last two years</p><p>JTIC data shows that between 2016 and 2017, counter-terrorism
operations as part of investigations into far-right extremist
activity or hate crimes in the UK increased by 88% with 17
operations recorded in both 2017 and 2018 to date.</p><p>UK Home Office statistics released in September showed that the
number of suspected right-wing extremists had increased from 4% of
those held on terrorism charges to 13% between June 2016 and 2018.
The statistics also revealed that arrests of Caucasian terrorism
suspects had outnumbered those of an Asian background for the first
time since June 2005.</p><p>In addition, the then head of the Metropolitan police''s
counter-terrorism branch Mark Rowley stated in February that four
right-wing extremist plots had been thwarted by police in 2017 and
that a third of referrals to the government''s
counter-radicalisation strategy Prevent were engaged in right-wing
extremist terrorism.</p><p></p><p>National Action trials</p><p>The increase of right-wing extremist activity in the UK since
2016 was reflected in the designation of National Action as a
terrorist group by the UK government in 2016. Despite the
designation, the group has continued to operate in various guises
and aliases - such as Scottish Dawn and NS131 which were also
subsequently designated by the UK government. In the last 12
months, for example, JTIC has recorded the arrest of 15 suspected
National Action members and six trials involving in the group.</p><p>Attacks - tactics and targets</p><p>Although National Action has not been implicated in directing or
conducting any successful attacks, lone right-wing extremists have.
In the last 12 months, JTIC has recorded 13 attacks conducted by
right-wing extremists or with a racial or religious discriminatory
motive, although this represented a decrease from 32 between 2016
and 2017, where spikes were recorded following a series of militant
Islamist attacks in the UK.</p><p>The targeting of mosques and Muslims was indicative of the
target preferences of right-wing extremists in the UK. Other
religious and ethnic minorities and LGBT+ people are also at risk
of attack from these actors. In the latter case, a plot to attack
an LGBT+ night in June 2017 was foiled and the suspect involved was
sentenced to an indefinite hospital order on 30 May for plotting
the attack.</p><p>German far right attacks rise by 60% in last 12
months</p><p>In Germany, JTIC recorded eight attacks with a suspected
right-wing extremist motive in the last 12 months - up from five
between 2016 and 2017. Notably, this including the stabbing of the
mayor of the town of Altena in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia
on 27 November.</p><p>At least six counter-terrorism operations targeting right-wing
extremists in Germany were also recorded during this period.
Notably, this included the dismantling of a group identifying
themselves as "Revolution Chemnitz" on 1 October who allegedly
plotted to conduct attacks on foreign nationals and those with
opposing political views to coincide with Germany''s Unity Day on 3
October. Violent clashes erupted in Chemnitz between far-right
extremists, counter-protesters, and police on 26-27 August,
following the arrest of a Syrian and an Iraqi man in alleged
connection with the killing of a German man on 25 August that
prompted anti-migrant demonstrations.</p><p>The attack involved a greater deal of planning and coordination
compared to the majority of right-wing extremist plots. The plot
was similar in nature to the actions of "Gruppe Freital" who
conducted a series of attacks against asylum seeker accommodation
in 2015, and eight members of this group were convicted in March
for founding a terrorist group and attempted murder.</p><p>Italian right wing attacks jump three-fold</p><p>Over the preceding 12 months, JTIC has recorded 13 attacks
targeting migrants and religious minorities in the country, a
significant uptick from three in the 12 months prior. Notably, on 3
February, a far-right extremist opened fire on migrants in
Macerata, wounding six people. Attacks have largely targeted
African migrants in the country, including three attacks involving
shooting individuals with a pellet gun in June.</p><p>There is a risk that with a far-right government in office,
individuals will become more emboldened to conduct attacks spurred
on by rhetoric from politicians and right-wing news outlets.
Additionally, there is also a growing threat of retaliatory
violence against far-right actors.</p><p>JTIC has recorded four attacks targeting far-right activists and
assets, including an IED attack targeting an office of the
far-right CasaPound party in Trento on 7 March.</p><p>

Jane''s Intelligence Review and available as part of 
Jane''s Military and Security Assessments Intelligence
Centre.</p><p>The Philippine government has said that the country''s communist
insurgency will be defeated by mid-2019. However, Mark Wilson shows
that the insurgency is thriving in cyberspace, using multiple
social media platforms to carry out recruitment campaigns and to
spread its ideology.</p><p>Key Points</p><p>On 31 October, Philippine Secretary of National Defence Delfin
Lorenzana announced that the military was on track to defeat
communist militants who have waged a five-decade insurgency against
the government. He said that in 2018 alone, 907 rebels had
voluntarily surrendered, 1,238 rebel firearms had been seized, and
210 barangays (local government districts) had been cleared of
communist influence.</p><p>The insurgency is led by the New People''s Army (NPA), the armed
wing of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP). In July 2016,
President Rodrigo Duterte declared a unilateral ceasefire with the
communists in an attempt to forge peace. However, those efforts
fell apart, with the government claiming that the NPA was still
carrying out attacks while negotiating for peace. On 23 November
2017, Duterte terminated the talks and declared that the CPP and
NPA were "terrorist" organisations.</p><p>Nevertheless, although the government is focusing on the ground
war, Jane''s research shows how the NPA and the CPP have cultivated
a strong online presence across the social media platforms of
Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and YouTube. This presence is
reinforced through retweets, mentions, and hashtags that link
NPAcommands with official CPP media outlets, as well as the
National Democratic Front of the Philippines (NDFP), an umbrella
leftist organisation that has conducted peace talks on behalf of
the NPA-CPP.</p><p>NPA Commands</p><p>Jane''s has classified the insurgency''s online activity into two
categories: the NPA commands that claim attacks, drive recruitment
campaigns, post photographs of life in militant camps, and promote
Maoist ideology; and CPP and NDFP activities, which play a more
strategic role in offering guidance to NPA militants, defending the
militants from criticism, and boosting the fighters'' morale. These
posts also try to bolster NPA recruitment by exploiting political
and military developments on the ground.</p><p>Jane''s has identified at least 19 NPA commands with an online
presence. Six of these commands limit themselves to the blogging
platforms Blogger and WordPress. The rest are more social-network
focused, using Facebook and Twitter as their media outlets.</p><p>The commands are located throughout the Philippines. Jane''s
mapping of their online presence indicates that commands in certain
regions tend to gravitate towards the use of particular social
media platforms. For example, those on the southern islands of
Mindanao, Negros, and Palawan tend to use Facebook, while those in
the central regions of Bicol, Calabarzon, and Visayas favour
Blogger.</p><p>When claiming an attack, NPA commands post written statements,
but the NPA commands on Facebook and Twitter have adapted their
approach, creating stylised images with key details of an attack
that lend themselves to being easily shared on social media.</p><p>This is an extract from an article published in

the speed and reach of social media in the ''fake news'' era has lent
new potency to the threat and has forced militaries to grapple with
the challenges and opportunities posed by modern editing
technologies and mass communication tools. Gerrard Cowan
reports</p><p>This is an extract from an article published in 
Jane''s Defence Weekly and available as part of 
Jane''s Military and Security Assessments Intelligence
Centre</p><p>Fake news can pose significant challenges to militaries: for
example, commercially available tools could enable adversaries to
manipulate a photo or video to create a false impression that
soldiers have carried out a particular action, which may undermine
their position in a local community. This presents obvious
operational challenges and could increase dangers to personnel.</p><p>Colonel Joshua Major is the commander of Canada''s Task Force -
Latvia, placing him on one of the ''front lines'' of the fake news
battle from a military perspective. Col Major explained that he
prefers the term ''disinformation'' to ''fake news'' because the
scourge of false stories labelled as fake news are simply the
latest episode in what has long been a challenge for militaries.
Such stories, the colonel noted, are often supported by manipulated
images and videos that are transmitted through social media or
online news sites.</p><p>"It is a concern," he said, "because it has the ability to
affect the perceptions of a population or a targeted group within a
population, and give them an understanding of a situation that''s
not factual or correct".</p><p>Col Major told Jane''s that he has not been surprised by
the use of online disinformation that has been encountered during
the Task Force - Latvia mission, including the use of doctored
images and even videogame footage to support a fake story. He
confirmed that the task force was aware of the potential dangers
and prepared to deal with the challenge. Similar disinformation
tactics have been used across the Baltics, in Poland, and beyond,
he noted, with individual examples varying greatly in
sophistication and quality. According to Col Major, some images and
videos "verge on the ridiculous" and are easily recognised as being
false by the casual observer.</p><p>However, he warned that there is also a much more pernicious,
subtle use of disinformation, combining some elements that may be
authentic but taking them out of context, changing the location, or
taking other measures to create a message that is fundamentally
false. "Nuggets of truth might be thrown into a [false] story,
perhaps with the context being changed, in order to make it more
believable," the colonel explained.</p><p>In these instances, the majority of the story may be factually
correct, in terms of numbers, dates, places, and other information.
However, Col Major said, it is "spun in such a way that the message
is untrue in the end … that is the real challenge in this
space: being able to understand what is real and what is fake. And
it''s becoming increasingly difficult to do so".</p><p>Col Major described how fake news or disinformation is generally
aimed at targeted groups of individuals with the purpose of
communicating a particular message to them. Although he said he
believes the majority of people are unlikely to be influenced by
such effects, particularly when the image or video is poor quality,
there are people who are "borderline", meaning they may already be
susceptible to, or agree with, the message the propagandists are
conveying. In these cases the use of fake news can serve to
reinforce pre-existing beliefs. According to Col Major, this can
have a real effect: for example, if a manipulated piece of media
claims that Canadian or other soldiers have attacked a local
person, it could affect the perception of personnel in that area,
which "may have an operational impact in certain areas," he
emphasised.</p><p>In such a scenario, "our first duty is to make sure we get in
there and provide an accurate description of what actually
happened", he said, with Task Force - Latvia seeking to respond to
potentially dangerous instances of disinformation. The aim, he
highlighted, is to be completely transparent.</p><p>Col Major said troops understand and expect the threats that can
arise from disinformation, so their own morale is not likely to be
affected, even if members of the task force are the targets of such
an attack. "Troops get it," he said. "They know there will be some
fake news and disinformation put out there about them. They
understand that and they just get on with the work."</p><p>This is an extract from an article published in

Asia-Pacific''s most influential aerospace and defence exhibitions,
along with other regional headliners, such as Aero India, Singapore
Airshow and South Korea ADEX.</p><p>Previous editions of Airshow China have been used for the first

stealth fighter prototype, J-20 multirole stealth combat aircraft,
Y-20 airlifter, and KJ-200 airborne early warning and control
aircraft.</p><p>Airshow China 2018 is expected to further up the ante. Early

to demonstrate the People Liberation Army Air Force''s increasing
confidence and experience with its latest aircraft, which was only
commissioned in September 2017.</p><p>A J-10C technology demonstrator, featuring an advanced thrust

the Iraqi Army.</p><p>Another highlight of Airshow China 2018 will be the large
selection of new and updated land, missile, and command, control,
communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance and
reconnaissance (C4ISR) systems. Although principally a commercial

Technology Policy announced a new strategy for advancing research
in quantum computing and encryption. The audience for the
announcement included representatives from a range of leading
US-based companies, including several of the US''s most prominent
defence contractors.</p><p>On the same day, the US Department of Energy announced USD218
million in funding for 85 research awards in quantum information
science. Earlier, on 13 September, the US House of Representatives
had passed the National Quantum Initiative Act, which provided
USD1.3 billion of funding over five years to "ensure the continued
leadership of the United States in quantum information science and
its technology applications".</p><p>These moves reflect an acknowledgement of the strategic
importance of quantum technologies for the future of a wide range
of critical commercial, civil, and defence and security endeavours.
However, Jane''s judges that they also reflect a broader sense of
growing alarm in the US defence, intelligence, and policymaking
communities that the US has ceded the initiative to China in the
development of a range of emerging technologies that will shape the
future of defence capabilities and military-technological
advantage.</p><p>Intensifying competition</p><p>China and the US are engaged in a multi-dimensional
geopolitical, economic, military, and technological competition.
This competition has become more complex since 2013, as China has
become more assertive - most prominently in the South China Sea -
and as perceptions of overwhelming US military and technological
superiority and strategic coherence in the Indo-Pacific region have
eroded. The military-technological dimension of this competition is
particularly meaningful. China''s military modernisation programme
has matured, rearranging the military balances and stabilising
imbalances that have helped sustain security in the region since

of the full parameters of China''s innovation system and of the
Indo-Pacific military-technological competition.</p><p>Second, US responses are also likely to include an effort to
build capabilities. Beyond developing new weapon systems and
platforms, this is likely to involve efforts to find a more
sustainable approach to leveraging its world-leading hi-tech

one of the most developed economies in the region. The country''s
solid monetary policy is safeguarded by the independence of the
South African Reserve Bank (SARB).</p><p>While the election of Cyril Ramaphosa as the new leader of the
ANC in December 2017 has been positive for investor confidence, the
2019 election does create some uncertainty in the country''s
economic outlook. Furthermore, the focus of the new leadership in
the interim appears to be education, justice and social care over
defence.</p><p>In real terms, South African defence spending in 2018 is back
down to levels seen in 2010 after the cancellation of the Airbus
A400M Atlas programme. However, should economic growth stabilise
and immediate social concerns be addressed in the next three to
five years, increases for the South African defence budget should
gather momentum from 2022.</p><p>Beyond the subdued short-term outlook, the budget will need to
increase by at least 7% annually (2% in real terms) from 2022 to
address the capability gaps that have emerged over the last decade.
By 2030, Jane''s expects South African defence spending to reach
USD7.5 billion (USD4.5bn in 2018$). As a proportion of GDP, the
defence budget is expected to hold steady at just below 1%.</p><p>From 2020, Jane''s expects defence procurement to increase as a
proportion of the budget, reaching almost 20% in 2030 from 11% this
year as the country seeks to replace key capabilities, including
the Lockheed Martin C-130BZ transport fleet.</p><p></p><p>Exports remain vital to the defence
industry</p><p>As South African defence investment in its own procurements has
been under considerable pressure over the past decade, the
country''s defence industrial base has needed to focus on exports to
sustain its capabilities and develop new solutions using external
sources of funding.</p><p>South Africa has been able to develop some highly competitive
defence equipment solutions for the global market based on the
country''s harsh operating environment and excellent technical
capabilities,.</p><p>These efforts have been most notable in the land systems domain.
Exports of armoured vehicles have seen companies such as Denel, DCD
Protected Mobility and Paramount Group export platforms and
subsystems to countries such as Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Malaysia,
and the United States. These have included not just armoured
fighting vehicles, but also the DCD Protected Mobility developed
Husky, which has been widely respected and adopted for counter-IED
work.</p><p>Beyond land systems, South African expertise has been utilised
to develop air-launched weapons systems such as the Denel Dynamics
A-Darter air-to-air missile, developed with Brazil, and a range of
electronic warfare and electro-optical systems. Paramount Group has
also worked to develop a surveillance and light-attack aircraft,
the AHRLAC and Mwari respectively, with the company reportedly
already working on an export order. The firm is now targeting
possible requirements for the platform in the United States through
the launching of the Bronco II programme and is exploring potential
build and supply chain options in the US.</p><p>Pushing the boundaries into emerging and peer markets, while
also pursuing opportunities in more mature markets, shows that
industry has a high degree of self-confidence that is backed up by
the track record of its capabilities. Openness to partnerships will
remain a key feature of South African industry as it works to
export its solutions to the global market, and move beyond a
traditional supplier-customer relationship.</p><p>Despite these export efforts, increased procurement from the
South African government in defence equipment - particularly as
outlined under the Defence Review - would help to drive the
country''s defence industrial base, with micro-, small-, and
medium-sized enterprises likely to significantly benefit from
acquisitions.</p><p></p><p>Learn more about

spend over USD100 billion on their defence capabilities for the
first time next year, with increasing budgets in Saudi Arabia and
the United Arab Emirates (UAE) driving growth between 2018 and
2027.</p><p>Across the Gulf states comprising the GCC (Saudi Arabia, UAE,
Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain and Oman), defence budgets are expected to
reach record highs next year, with increases in spending primarily
focused on modernising and expanding military force structure and
improving readiness in response to continuing regional
instability.</p><p>"The 6 percent growth in defence expenditure in the GCC that
we''ve seen this year is expected to slow, but growth rates of 3 to
4 percent a year are sustainable over the next decade - meaning
that defence spending is likely to hit a record USD100 billion next
year," said Craig Caffrey, principal defence budgets analyst at
Jane''s by IHS Markit. "If we see any significant increases in oil
prices, we''ll probably see further growth - or at the very least,
more procurement activity."</p><p>Jane''s Defence Budgets data says that despite predicted
fluctuations in the growth rate, defence spending will continue to
increase over the next five years, reaching around USD117 billion
by 2023. In total, the states of the GCC are expected to spend
around USD86 billion on defence equipment over the next five
years.</p><p>GCC defence budgets have risen as a percentage of GDP over
recent years, but even more significantly are also rising as a
share of government spending; highlighting the importance placed on
enhancing military capabilities.</p><p></p><p>A major driving factor in defence procurement plans has been the
increase in operational activity by GCC militaries in places such
as Iraq, Libya, Syria and Yemen. Such actions have led to an
increase in spending on the development of expeditionary and
intelligence gathering capabilities, as well as the bolstering of
combat aircraft fleets.</p><p>Can the GCC escape North American export
domination?</p><p>Despite accounting for just 5 percent of global defence spending
the GCC is responsible for almost a quarter of all imports of
defence equipment - importing assets worth approximately USD56
billion between 2014 and 2018.</p><p>North America and Europe provide about 95 percent of all
equipment acquired by Gulf states. The US alone has accounted for
about half of all exports to the GCC in the last five years.
However, despite the prevalence of equipment from these sources,
other suppliers - ranging from Australia to China and Turkey - are
increasing their market presence.</p><p>"The modernisation and operational requirements of some
militaries in the region are seeing some governments turn to
alternative suppliers for equipment," said Charles Forrester,
senior defence industry analyst at Jane''s by IHS Markit.</p><p>"The downturn in oil prices in 2014 and 2015 made cost an
important factor, while export controls from some key suppliers
have prevented the transfer of desired equipment," Forrester said.
"Similarly, operators in the region are becoming increasingly
conscious of the cost of procurements and through-life support
costs of equipment and systems."</p><p>Jane''s Markets Forecast has identified USD48 billion in
announced requirements and USD32 billion in unannounced
opportunities in the GCC region over the next decade.</p><p></p><p>Self-sufficiency ambitions</p><p>Countries in the region are also continuing to leverage large
defence procurements to improve domestic military and non-military
technological capabilities through offset programmes. Most notably,
Saudi Arabia aims to increase domestic defence procurement spending
from 2 percent to 50 percent by 2030 as part of the country''s
Vision 2030 goals.</p><p>Both the UAE and Saudi Arabia aim to improve their own defence
industrial bases to improve self-sufficiency and ensure the
security of supply for their own militaries. They also intend to
leverage this capability to boost exports of locally made defence
equipment, with the UAE already exporting its Nimr protected
vehicle to countries including Algeria and Turkmenistan.</p><p>"Efforts to expand indigenous production over the next decade
will need to be in partnership with foreign suppliers," Forrester
said. "Requirements and supplier relationships may be shifting, but
the overall strength of the market remains unchanged."</p><p>.</p><p>Learn more about

practical for open-source analysts to carry out radio direction
finding. Writing for Jane''s, Tony Roper examines the impact the new
tool is having on open-source analysis.</p><p>Key Points</p><p>Identifying the location of a radio transmitter is a core
capability of military and government signals intelligence units.
However, open-source analysts have encountered challenges in
replicating this capability. The development of new software for an
existing network of online software-defined radios (SDRs)
incorporating global navigation satellite system (GNSS) timestamps
has rapidly changed this situation in 2018. It is increasingly
practical for an open-source analyst with an internet connection to
conduct rudimentary DF.</p><p>TDoA measures the time-of-flight differences of a signal
received at different locations. The basic principle is that the
difference in the arrival time of a signal at two receivers,
obtained by cross-correlating the two signals, can be used to
calculate a hyperbola of possible locations for the transmitter.
Conducting measurements from more than two receivers enables the
calculation of multiple hyperbolae, and the point at which these
intersect identifies the location of the transmitter.</p><p></p><p>Jane''s conducted two case studies to assess the
effectiveness of DF using the KiwiSDR TDoA plug-in. The first used
a signal from a known transmitter site used by the Royal
Netherlands Navy at Goeree-Overflakkee island, southwest of
Rotterdam. The signals being transmitted were encrypted STANAG 4285
messages.</p><p>The capability afforded by networked SDRs will almost certainly
remain orders of magnitude less effective than the capabilities of
military and government signals units. With the software and
hardware highly likely to improve, the key constraint on the
technique''s effectiveness in the future is likely to be the number
of SDR receivers available in different parts of the world.
Nonetheless, it represents a new tool for open-source analysts and
one that has yet to be fully exploited.</p><p>This is an extract from an article published in

shipping is a low-probability, high-impact scenario with global
ramifications. As Iran-US tensions heighten ahead of Washington''s
reimposition of sanctions on Tehran from 6 August, Jeremy
Binnie , Reed Foster , and Nazanin Soroush
analyse the indicators of conflict in the Strait and the likely
trajectory of any confrontation.</p><p>Key Points</p><p>A war of words between Washington and Tehran has again focused
international attention on Iran''s ability to threaten freedom of
movement through the economically vital Strait of Hormuz. Iranian
President Hassan Rouhani on 3 July stated that the US policy of
halting Iran''s oil exports would mean that the region''s oil would
not be exported. Two days later, Major-General Mohammad Ali Jafari,
the commander of Iran''s Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC),
said that the Strait of Hormuz was either for "all" or for
"no-one".</p><p>Nonetheless, Iranian action to close the Strait of Hormuz
remains highly unlikely. Jane''s assesses that the Iranian
threats were primarily intended to put pressure on the remaining
signatories to the Iran nuclear agreement known as the Joint
Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) - France, China, Germany,
Russia, and the United Kingdom - to compensate Iran for its
continued nuclear compliance.</p><p>The United States unilaterally withdrew from the nuclear
agreement on 8 May and re-imposed powerful extra-territorial
sanctions intended to prevent other states from doing business with
Iran. US President Donald Trump has pursued a policy of putting
pressure on Iran, tweeting on 23 July that Iran risked
"consequences the likes of which few throughout history have ever
suffered before", if it threatened the US again.</p><p>Although it is likely that some of its claims are inflated, Iran
does have the military capability to threaten shipping in the
waterway. Similarly, the US has responded by adjusting the
composition and capabilities of forces to mitigate such threats. An
Iranian attempt to close the Strait would therefore be at high risk
of sparking a military conflict between the two sides - a scenario
that would have global ramifications.</p><p></p><p>Significance of the Strait</p><p>IHS Markit Maritime & Trade data make clear the Strait''s
importance. Between 1 July 2017 and 30 June 2018, IHS Markit
Maritime & Trade AISLive data recorded 42,544 transits by

mainstream social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, and
Google Plus. However, other platforms such as the messaging app
Telegram have gradually become a primary feature of the online
militant landscape in Indonesia, as evidenced in the January 2018
report Counter-Terrorist Trends and Analyses by the Singapore-based
S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies. The report claimed
that pro-Islamic State online networks in Indonesia had partly
shifted to more closed platforms such as Telegram that permitted

secrecy not afforded by the more mainstream social media platforms.
Indonesian extremists using the platform either join channels,

Indonesian militants'' activities under four broad rubrics. First,
there are the ''threat makers'', who identify specific individuals or
places for attack; second are the disseminators, who repackage,
translate, and spread official Islamic State media content with an

Capabilities, Jane''s by IHS Markit</p><p>The US European Reassurance / Deterrence
Initiative</p><p>The US European Reassurance Initiative (ERI) was announced in
June 2014 in response to Russian military activism in the Ukraine.
Since then, the ERI has been rechristened the European Deterrence
Initiative (EDI) and funding has increased significantly, from
USD985 million in FY15 to a proposed USD6.5 billion in FY19.</p><p>The initiative includes a range of measures that increase US
military presence in Europe, expand training and multinational
exercises, grow the stocks of prepositioned equipment, improve
infrastructure, and build partner capacity. The purpose of these
efforts is to convince both Europe and Russia that the US is
committed to the security and territorial integrity of their NATO
allies.</p><p>ERI/EDI funding: building power projection
capability</p><p>ERI/EDI spending is intended for two main purposes. The first is
to increase rotational presence of US military forces and the
second is to build up the stockpile of permanent prepositioned
equipment in Europe.</p><p>The funding has enabled the continuous presence of a US-based
Armored Brigade Combat Team in Europe, commencing in early
2017.</p><p>This creates a permanent armored brigade presence and thus
brings the total US Army footprint in Europe up to three brigades -
the 173rd Airborne Brigade in Italy, the 2nd Cavalry Regiment in
Germany, and the rotational armored brigade.</p><p>The rotational brigade deploys primarily to the Baltic Republics
and Poland, but also to Bulgaria and Romania.</p><p>Practically speaking, the posture of permanent rotation has at
least two advantages for US forces.</p><p>First, it gives a large number of US Army units experience with
their eastern allies.</p><p>Second, since each rotational brigade brings all of its own
equipment, the US Army is building up experience in rapidly
deploying a heavy brigade to and within Europe.</p><p>However, the rotational postures take numerically more soldiers
and equipment since there must always be forces deployed, as well
as other forces getting ready to deploy and those recovering from
deployment.</p><p>Given that the US Army currently has only ten armoured brigades
and already has rotational commitments in South Korea and Kuwait,
it could find itself stretched thin over the next few years.</p><p>In addition to the three fully manned brigades, as of the end of
2017, the US Army has enough prepositioned combat-ready equipment
in Europe to outfit another armoured brigade.</p><p>The goal is to build this up into a division-size set of
equipment, enough for two armoured brigades and two artillery
brigades, as well as air defence, engineer, and other support
units.</p><p>The rotational presence and prepositioning, as well as the
exercises and infrastructure projects funded by the ERI/EDI, are
building a system that allows the US to rapidly increase the size
of its forces in Europe.</p><p>NATO''s rotational Enhanced Forward Presence</p><p>There have been many small-scale deployments of non-US NATO
land, air, and naval forces to Eastern Europe since the Crimea
crisis. However, from 2014 through 2016 these were largely ad hoc
and intermittent.</p><p>Now, as part of its Enhanced Forward Presence mission, NATO has
placed a four multinational battalion-size battlegroups in Eastern
Europe: in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland.</p><p>The battlegroups were put in place at the start of 2017,
although it took a good part of the year for many to build up to
full strength.</p><p>These battlegroups are led by the United Kingdom, Canada,
Germany and the United States respectively. Almost every NATO
country has rotated in troops to the battlegroups since they were
stood up, with 18 NATO members contributing as of mid-2018.</p><p>At the core of each battlegroup is a mechanised infantry
battalion with armoured fighting vehicles (provided by the lead
nation). This battalion is reinforced with tank, artillery, air
defence, and other combat support and service support units (from
the lead and supporting nations).</p><p>This composition means that the battlegroups essentially form a
NATO mechanised infantry brigade spread across Poland and the
Baltics.</p><p>Importantly, the battlegroups have extensive training
opportunities. This is allowing NATO forces to focus on rebuilding
their high-intensity conventional warfare skills.</p><p>Baltic Republics military build-up limited compared to
adversaries but part of greater whole</p><p>All three of the Baltic Republics are undertaking procurement
programmes to build up their land warfare capability.</p><p>These are significant enhancement of military capabilities in
the Baltic Republics, but they are only significant relative to the
resources and current capabilities of these countries. They are not
alone significant when compared to possible adversaries.</p><p>While limited in comparison to the land inventories of larger
NATO countries, these procurement programmes will enable the Baltic
Republics to carry out modern combined arms manoeuvre warfare. This
is a step change in warfighting capability.</p><p>In short, they will finally be fully integrated into NATO''s
warfighting model and contribute to the combat power of the NATO
battlegroups and the alliance as whole.</p><p>Are the current NATO efforts enough to deter Russia from
military adventurism?</p><p>It is generally accepted that the risks of conflict are low,
despite current political tensions.</p><p>But despite the low risks at the moment, the question of who has
the advantage is still important.</p><p>The majority of analysts do not believe there are enough US
forces in Europe or sufficient capability within other NATO
countries to deter or defeat Russia.</p><p>Russia has more brigades and if it so desired, it could, for
example, simply overrun the Baltic Republics.</p><p>However, conclusions cannot be based solely on numbers and force
ratios since war is not a direct meeting of two adversaries on a
featureless field.</p><p>Victory in war is not achieved by meeting the enemy directly but
by being able to respond and act where one''s opponent cannot, be it
on a flank, in a certain place, at a certain time, or in a certain
domain.</p><p>This is what the US EDI is building - an increased capacity to
act in a variety of ways which Russia cannot block unless it
overran all of Europe with total surprise.</p><p>In sum, the EDI is giving the US an ''army in being'' in Europe
that must be accounted for by Moscow and this reduces Russia''s
flexibility and freedom of action in the military realm. This,
combined with other NATO efforts, provides an adequate deterrent in
light of current risks.</p><p>Learn more about Jane''s

Base Budget, whereas Part II addressed USD135 million of changes in
the FY18 Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) budget.</p><p>While some reprogrammings are perfunctory, others can have large
impacts on DoD contractors as the changes may necessitate shifted
portfolio priorities and, therefore, project staffing. Jane''s
believes that is likely to occur with this request.</p><p>Most noteworthy FY18 reprogramming requests</p><p>The reprogramming request of 11 July 2018 also introduces 11 DoD
''New Start'' programmes in the FY18 budget:</p><p></p><p>BI = Background Investigation</p><p>It is assumed that most of these reprogramming requests will be
approved by the Congressional committees in the near future in
order for the services to continue to execute their budgets in an
effective manner.</p><p>President Trump''s defense strategy</p><p>Jane''s expects the reprogramming actions in this document to
serve as a precursor to the February 2019 FY20 PBR, which President
Trump has mentioned as being his first ''full up'' PBR under his
administration.</p><p>This reprogramming blends in nicely with the 3-pronged approach
to restore readiness and to rebuild the US depleted military which
President Trump is leading with able execution by Secretary of
Defense James Mattis. According to the President and SECDEF, the
approach is to "Get Ready - Get Balanced - Get Bigger and More
Lethal." Step 1 "Get Ready" occurred with the FY18 PBR submit of
May 2017 to address immediate readiness issues. Step 2 "Get
Balanced" is part of the February 2018 FY19 PBR submit to Congress,
presently being reviewed. The FY19 PBR is a ''transitional budget''
partially informed by five DoD studies.</p><p>The actions requested in this reprogramming shape and accelerate
this transition. The third step "Get Bigger and More Lethal" will
occur with the FY20 PBR submit in February 2019 - this PBR will
become President Trump''s "full up" informed defense budget worked
fully by his administration. The three steps are a logical
progression of the recent National Security Strategy issued by
President Trump in December 2017 and its companion National Defense
Strategy issued by SECDEF Mattis in January 2018.</p><p>About Jane''s US DoD analysis</p><p>Jane''s provides numerous US DoD budget displays during the

Jane''s Intelligence Review and available as part of 
Jane''s Military and Security Assessments Intelligence
Centre.</p><p>Organisations have struggled to quantify cyber-security
risk because of a shortage of data. Nick Hare writing for Jane''s
examines how structured analytic techniques can support risk
assessments before enough data is collected to enable quantitative
analysis.</p><p>Key Points</p><p>The prevailing commercial approach to managing cyber security is
one of ensuring compliance with pre-defined criteria. This
compliance is often verified by third parties from the rapidly
growing cyber-security industry. One example of these criteria
tools is the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). This
encourages firms to rate threats on a range of subjective metrics,
including access vectors, complexity of attack, and potential
impacts. These ratings are then combined to derive ''exploitability''
and ''impact'' scores, which are in turn used to produce a ''CVSS
vulnerability vector''.</p><p>The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) risk-rating
methodology performs a similar function, evaluating potential
threats on a range of impact and likelihood scores to produce an
overall "risk severity" rating. This rating is designed to help
firms to prioritise investment.</p><p>The UK government''s Cyber Essentials scheme is another
checklist-based standard. The scheme requires firms to implement a
set of technical controls (such as firewalls, access control, and
malware protection) to receive accreditation, which is a common
prerequisite for supplying services to government clients.</p><p>These approaches are focused on identifying and managing
vulnerabilities that are potential enablers for successful cyber
attacks. A vulnerability-based approach is easy to administer and
relies on features of a company that are easier to verify
objectively, minimising the need for specialist expertise. These
approaches provide an audit trail for a firm''s security investment
decisions.</p><p></p><p>However, a purely vulnerability-based approach ignores the
probability that any of the vulnerabilities will be exploited.
Without an understanding of the probabilities of different threat
outcomes, the return on cyber-defence investment cannot be
calculated, and the potential value of cyber-risk insurance cannot
be assessed.</p><p>Taking a purely vulnerability-driven approach also encourages
firms to prioritise the costliest potential threats, rather than
the most likely ones. This is likely to steer companies away from
cyber-security approaches that offer smaller benefits but at lower
cost.</p><p>This is an extract from an article published in

Jane''s Defence Weekly and available as part of 
Jane''s Defence Equipment and Technology Intelligence
Centre.</p><p>In 2017 France and Germany announced their intention to
develop a sixth-generation combat aircraft to replace the Typhoon,
Tornado, and Rafale aircraft that are currently in service. BAE
Systems, Leonardo, and Saab almost instantly expressed interest in
participating in the multi-billion-Euro programme, which is
expected to be led by Airbus and France''s Dassault Aviation. Mark
Bobbi reports.</p><p>France and Germany hope to develop a roadmap for a
sixth-generation combat aircraft programme this year, ideally with
concept studies and a hardware demonstration going on until the
mid-2020s. This would be followed by a definitive system
development and demonstration (SDD) effort, resulting in initial
operational capability (IOC) and an in-service date in about 2045,
10 years later than the comparable US Air Force (USAF)
Next-Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) aircraft (also known as the
Penetrating Counter Air platform).</p><p>The United Kingdom''s position in the programme is questionable
because of the ongoing Brexit process. However, such a programme
without the United Kingdom seems unlikely, given Rolls-Royce''s
propulsion experience together with BAE''s research and development
(R&D) prowess, production capabilities and F-35 learning. The
challenge for the United Kingdom is whether to support the US-led
NGAD effort, which will be based around a Joint Strike Fighter-type
model, or a Euro proposal that will be Franco-German led and based
on an Organisation for Joint Armament Co-operation (OCCAR) Typhoon
development and production model.</p><p>Why now?</p><p>Why is Europe considering spending many billions of Euros on a
new manned combat aircraft? In the European tradition the most
important reason is to retain industrial capability. In an era with
industrial ''peers'' in development or production of fifth-generation
combat aircraft, industrial policy is paramount. Analysis by Jane''s
on Chinese, Indian, Japanese, Russian, South Korean, and Turkish
advanced combat aircraft efforts suggests that, of these countries,
China represents the biggest threat, with two aircraft to be
concerned about right now. Furthermore, with the United States
spending hundreds of billions of dollars on fifth-generation
aircraft and beginning development of sixth-generation bombers and
fighters (the B-21 Raider long-range strike bomber and NGAD), there
is a danger that Europe will fall so far behind in advanced combat
aircraft development capabilities that it would risk the complete
collapse of its military aircraft industry and a strategic problem
of biblical proportions. That simply will not happen - at least
according to defence industry insiders and supporting politicians
in France and Germany.</p><p>Cost</p><p>Another big question is what will such a programme cost? Some
are calling this programme a fifth-generation fighter and others
say it will be a sixth-generation aircraft. Its IOC of 2040-45
suggests it will be a sixth-generation aircraft, although Europe
has not developed a fifth-generation aircraft aside from BAE''s
participation in the F-35 and that of Rolls-Royce in the aircraft''s
short take-off/vertical landing (STOVL) propulsion system. So
Europe has a lot of catching up to do, which will be expensive.
There have been estimates in the region of USD50 billion, which,
based on precedent, are not out of the question.</p><p>This is an extract from an article published in Jane''s Defence

Jane''s examines the group''s operational trajectory and assesses its current threat and capability level.</p><p>Key Points</p><p>In November 2017, the Islamic State in Somalia began to rapidly expand its attacks in southern Somalia, specifically in and around the country''s capital city, Mogadishu, and the strategically important town of Afgooye located about 30 kilometers from the former. Pro-Islamic State forces first emerged in the semi-autonomous region of Puntland in northeastern Somalia in October 2015 as a splinter faction of Harakat al-Shabaab al-Mujahideen, and in 2016 claimed attacks in southern and western Somalia and in neighboring Kenya. Its attacks in these areas decreased between January and mid-November 2017 with the bulk of its operations taking place during this period in Puntland. The renewal of a sustained campaign and series of attacks in the south by the Islamic State''s forces in Somalia - referenced as Wilayat Sumaal (Somalia province) by the Islamic State''s central media apparatus in December 2017 but not in other subsequent releases through affiliated agencies - suggests that it has been able to make new inroads in the region despite the successes of its primary militant Islamist rival, Al-Shabaab, in cracking down on defectors, killing or arresting many, and limiting the Islamic State''s further expansion in the country.</p><p>Pro-Islamic State militants in Somalia''s semi-autonomous Puntland region in September 2017 (IHS Markit)</p><p>Expansion of attacks in southern Somalia (November 2017-May 2018)</p><p>From 19 November 2017 and continuing through to 26 May 2018, Wilayat Sumaal claimed 25 attacks in or around Mogadishu and Afgooye or their suburbs including the Elisha district in the Shabeellaha Hoose region outside the capital, all of which were conducted using firearms and targeting individuals accused of working for the Federal Government of Somalia (FGS). Most of the targeted victims were accused by the Islamic State''s semi-official Amaq News Agency of working for the army (6), police (8), the National Intelligence and Security Agency (NISA; 12), or the Ministry of Finance (1). Amaq released short videos of six of the attacks and the Islamic State''s official media network released photographs of four other attacks. In all but one of these videos and photography sets, the targeted victim was shown wearing civilian clothing rather than a uniform or other insignia identifying them as being employed by the FGS. The identities of the attackers were not given.</p><p>Of the 10 attacks for which visual media was released to document the assassinations in this six-month period, three were conducted at night and seven during the day in public places including busy urban centers and streets. The majority of the Amaq reports on the attacks did not specify in which districts or areas the assassinations were committed. Of the reports that did identify specific districts, these included Tawfiq (near Mogadishu Stadium), Hawl Wadaag, Hodan, and Bakaara Market in Mogadishu, and the nearby suburb of Elisha in Shabeellaha Hoose region, immediately to the capital''s west and south. In the same period, Wilayat Sumaal claimed two attacks in Puntland, the first a 13 December 2017 attack using an improvised-explosive device (IED) to destroy a Puntland regional government army vehicle in the city of Bosaso, and the second a 14 March 2018 assassination of a Puntland police officer.</p><p>This is an extract from a report featured in Jane''s Terrorism and Insurgency Centre, which delivers a structured, consistent and comprehensive database of open source events related to non-state armed groups.

"The use of a VBIEDs or SVBIEDs in Europe by militant Islamists would significantly increase the potential fatality of attacks, and give militants more control over the level of destruction by studying the most efficient placement of the explosives."</p><p>There are indicators that some cells have already attempted to adopt this method. For example, the cell that conducted the 17 August 2017 vehicle-impact and knife attacks in Barcelona and Cambrils, Spain, had been using a safe house in Alcanar to prepare a substantial amount of explosives, before an accidental detonation destroyed the building and likely sped up the execution of the subsequent attacks. According to Catalan police after the incident, the materials discovered at the bomb-making site included the explosive triacetone triperoxide (TATP), used in the high-profile attacks in Paris and Brussels, as well as more than 120 butane gas tanks and an explosive suicide belt.</p><p>Notably, Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) has published guides on the construction of alternative VBIEDs in the West, which are structured around a standard IED and a vehicle packed with gas tanks - not dissimilar to those sought by the Barcelona attackers. In addition, Islamic State has published video instructions for creating TATP.</p><p>Drones pose growing threat from above</p><p>Militants may also employ new technologies, such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) or ''drones'', in attacks to reach new targets or increase the publicity and impact of an attack.</p><p>"The Islamic State and other Islamist militant groups have used UAVs rigged with explosives in Iraq and Syria, and their use in conflict zones is becoming more sophisticated and varied - increasing the likelihood of their adoption in Europe," Iho said.</p><p>For instance, on 5 January, unidentified militants used 13 GPS-guided fixed-wing UAVs rigged with IEDs to target Russia''s Humaymim Air Base and its naval base in Latakia, Syria, reportedly operating the devices from as far away as 100km. Although Russian air defences brought down the UAVs and the attack was unsuccessful, the incident illustrated the risk posed by such technology to less hardened targets in Europe.</p><p>"Airports, power stations, public transport, symbolic targets, sports stadiums, amusement parks, or other places with large gatherings of people in Europe are likely to lack the types of defences that could prevent a swarm of UAVs rigged with dozens of explosive devices from causing significant damage," Iho said.</p><p>"These devices are available commercially and can provide an effective weapon at reasonable cost, particularly for militants with prior experience of adapting them in Syria," Iho said.</p><p></p><p>Get in touch to learn more about JTIC and other solutions from Jane''s.</p>', 'https://ihsmarkit.com/research-analysis/islamic-states-foreign-fighters-bring-terrorism-expertise-back-to-europe.html');

There is a substantial degree of continuity from the pre-intervention period, where those three governorates were again the location of the most airstrikes and collectively accounted for 64.1 percent of all strikes in that timeframe.</p><p>Tactical airstrikes have facilitated recovery of territories by Syrian state</p><p>Russian intervention has been instrumental in not only ensuring the continued survival of the Assad government but also reversing the momentum of the conflict decisively in favour of government forces against a broad range of opposition forces in the country.</p><p>According to Conflict Monitor by IHS Markit, the state controlled just 15.9 percent (29,450 square kilometres) of territory in Syria in mid-September 2015. By contrast, at the end of March 2018, this had almost tripled to 47.4 percent (87,995 sq km) of the country. In addition to capturing large swathes of central Syria, this major territorial gain included the securing of vital urban centres and key strategic locations.</p><p>In particular, the state has re-established full control over the city of Aleppo, removed the Islamic State threat to Hama and Homs, re-established full control over Deir al-Zour city, secured the border with Lebanon, significantly reduced the threat to the capital Damascus, and effectively contained a significant proportion of the militant Islamist opposition in Idlib governorate.</p><p></p><p>Get in touch here to learn more about JTIC and other solutions from Jane''s.</p>', 'https://ihsmarkit.com/research-analysis/use-of-airstrikes-in-syrian-conflict.html');

A proportion of returnees will be known to the security services and therefore are likely to be detained or placed under surveillance.</p><p>"However, there remains a moderate risk of clandestinely returned fighters conducting attacks during the World Cup," Hawkins said. "Due to their combat experience in Iraq and Syria, those returnees will probably be proficient in constructing and deploying viable improvised explosive devices (IEDs) and in military-standard weapon-handling.</p><p>"They are unlikely, however, to have easy access to sufficient weapons and military-grade explosives to enable them to carry out sophisticated paramilitary-style mass casualty attacks (such as the September 2004 attack on a school in Beslan in North Ossetia-Alania that killed 334 people)," Hawkins said.</p><p>"Additionally, a more locally-driven threat comes from Islamist militants in the North Caucasus, who have - since the break-up of the Soviet Union - fought against Russia''s domination of their republics, driven by ethnic separatist, as well as jihadist, motivation," Hawkins said. "The main militant groups in Russia - the Islamic State''s affiliate Wilayat al-Qawqaz and the Al-Qaeda-aligned Imarat Kavkaz - are confined to the North Caucasus region."</p><p>Security countermeasures in place</p><p>"Security services are already at a heightened posture following the March 18 presidential election, and will remain in a high state of readiness for President Vladimir Putin''s inauguration in Moscow on May 7, and in other major cities for May 9 Victory Day commemorations," Hawkins said.

Elsewhere, authorities in Volgograd have installed 131 additional CCTV cameras ahead of the tournament and other host cities are likely to follow suit. Such measures are likely to assist in the timely detection and arrest of wanted individuals before they commit an attack.</p><p>"Outside of the host cities, and particularly in Chechnya and Dagestan, counter-terrorism operations are likely to intensify in an attempt to mitigate threats originating from there," Hawkins said. "Similar pre-emptive security operations were conducted in the North Caucasus ahead of the Sochi Winter Olympics in 2014, and probably contributed to the absence of any attacks."</p><p>Russia will hold the 2018 FIFA Football World Cup from June 14 -July 15 in 11 host cities across the country.</p><p>Watch an interview with Chris Hawkins to find out more about the ongoing terrorism trends in Russia.</p><p>Get in touch here to learn more about JTIC and other solutions from Jane''s.

Pyongyang views itself as a fully-fledged nuclear state and has traditionally seen calls to denuclearise in the context of global denuclearisation - a point that has been emphasised through Kim''s references to "worldwide disarmament" and the "total halt of nuclear tests."</p><p>It is likely that key conceptual differences will remain in interpreting the term "denuclearisation" between North Korea and the US. For example, last year China and the US agreed that efforts to denuclearise the Korean Peninsula should be "complete, verifiable and irreversible." Such an outcome is only possible through a complete declaration of North Korea''s nuclear infrastructure by Pyongyang and the permitting of intrusive inspections to verify that sites have indeed been dismantled or converted to alternative uses. Where there is doubt that North Korea''s declaration is inaccurate or incomplete, the international community will require a mechanism to investigate and gain confidence that North Korea''s has not simply established parallel facilities in which to continue its nuclear activities.</p><p>North Korea''s several recent conciliatory gestures to support its stated desire to disarm include the discontinuation of nuclear and intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) tests. It is important to note, however, that such language allows North Korea to resume such tests as required, and does not commit North Korea to cease the development work on such weapons behind the scenes.</p><p>Similarly, although Pyongyang has stated it will dismantle the Punggye-ri nuclear test site, the site itself is suspected of having structural issues and this may simply be a prudent decision from safety perspective. Furthermore, Punggye-ri''s closure does not preclude the possibilities that North Korean engineers are satisfied with the design of their nuclear devices (and thus no longer need to test); that a second facility could be established or the North could escalate to an atmospheric test still. In this sense, North Korea''s interpretation of denuclearisation is likely to revolve around decreasing the saliency of nuclear and missile tests in its diplomacy, rather than the complete, verifiable and irreversible disarmament desired by the West.</p><p>Indeed, resolutions passed following Kim''s address to the Third Plenary Meeting of the Seventh Central Committee of the ruling Workers'' Party of Korea (WPK) still emphasised the role of nuclear weapons in guaranteeing North Korea''s security, stating that "The DPRK will never use nuclear weapons … under any circumstances unless there are nuclear threats and nuclear provocation against the DPRK." While this marks a small clarification to North Korea''s April 2013 law on Consolidating the position of nuclear weapons state for self-defence, it hints at the permanence of North Korea''s perceptions.</p><p>Talks will have to address all of these issues, yet remain mindful of the fact that North Korea is a sovereign state that desires to be regarded as an equal power. In denuclearising the Korean peninsula, North Korea will likely expect reciprocal gestures, which may prompt further debate between the US and its regional allies over what level of forces are necessary to guarantee their security but also signal willingness to engage with Pyongyang.</p><p>Learn more here about how Jane''s can help you monitor the strategic global CBRN situation.</p>', 'https://ihsmarkit.com/research-analysis/will-north-korea-denuclearise.html');

Desired characteristics were a multiple-target engagement capability, the first for a Soviet SAM, anti-missile capability, high mobility, and suitability for use across the Soviet military. The latter was already common to a degree, for example with the Soviet Navy adopting the PVO''s S-125 (SA-3 GOA) as a naval SAM. MKB Strela, the forerunner of NPO Almaz, proposed the S-300.</p><p>Debate arose over whether one system could meet the requirements for the three intended service arms.</p><p>The S-300PS</p><p>Testing of the S-300PS, the fully capable iteration of the S-300P conceived in 1969, began in 1978 at Sary Shagan.

By 1988, both programme goals were consolidated under the S-400 banner, with the S-350 designator appearing again in the future as another S-300P replacement programme.</p><p>S-400 trials began at Kapustin Yar in 1993, using the 48N6D missile. Trials proceeded slowly due to the economic issues following the breakup of the Soviet Union.</p><p>Engagement Radars</p><p>All engagement radars can be mounted atop 40V6 series mast assemblies.</p><p>The radar has very low sidelobes due to the use of four sidelobe-cancelling antennas which surround the engagement radar array.

Any significant increases made to the budget in the short term will be effectively wiped out in real terms and the purchasing power of the Turkish budget will continue to be eroded on international markets.</p><p>Over the last decade, high levels of inflation have resulted in incredibly volatile movements in the Turkish defence budget, with surges in spending in one year often followed by real cuts in the next. Meanwhile, the low value of the lira against Western currencies will continue to act as a barrier for international investment and further drive Turkey towards the goal of total self-sufficiency in defence production by 2023.</p><p>According to Jane’s Defence Budgets, Turkey’s 2018 defence budget of USD13 billion places it 20th largest defence budget globally and the 8th largest in NATO behind the US, UK, France, Germany, Italy, Canada and Spain. In dollar terms, if the weakness of the lira persists, the Turkish defence budget will begin to fall out of the top 20 spenders in the early 2020s.</p><p>Economic outlook</p><p>According to IHS Markit, double-digit inflation rates seen in 2017 will persist throughout 2018 with consumer price index (CPI) inflation averaging 10% over the year. As the government targets 5% real GDP (Gross Domestic Product) growth this year, pressure from President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on the Central Bank of Turkey to avoid increasing interest rates has intensified. This in turn is fueling further depreciation of the lira which cyclically drives up inflation by increasing energy import and foreign debt repayment costs.</p><p>The lira fell to TRY4.07 against the dollar in April 2018 compared to an average rate of TRY2.2 to the dollar in 2013.</p><p>Without a significant tightening in monetary policy, IHS Markit project that the lira will remain subdued for the next decade - this will strain the affordability of defence programmes Turkey pursues with the West.</p><p>As the depreciation against the Russian ruble has been less severe, economic conditions may encourage further thawing of relations between the two countries.</p><p>Self-sufficiency aims</p><p>The importance of the depreciation of the lira in terms of domestic defence spending has been somewhat lessened by the continued efforts of the Undersecretariat for Defence Industries (SSM) to increase Turkish self-sufficiency.</p><p>Turkey is looking to achieve full self-sufficiency by 2023 and has already established strong domestic production capabilities in the wheeled military land systems domain as well as small arms and radar systems. Naval shipbuilding capabilities are credible, while C4ISR and aerospace competencies continue to develop with large-scale systems integrators and SMEs developing subsystems play a key role in any of these domestic capabilities.</p><p>Since the 1990s, Turkey has made significant headway in the pursuit of self-sufficiency with successive development plans geared towards enhancing operations within the domestic defence industry. However, production remains heavily reliant on designs, capabilities and technologies of international contractors with offset accords forming a significant proportion of defence industrial activity.</p><p>Defence investment drivers</p><p>From a security point of view, defence spending increases in Turkey continue to be driven by Turkey’s geographic position and potential flashpoints that include ongoing instability in neighbouring Syria and the encroachment of Islamic State.</p><p>Turkey also has commitments stemming from NATO membership. Several major programmes are also coming into the timeframe including the procurement of 100 Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II multirole fighter aircraft as replacement to F-16C/D under the Turkish Future Combat Aircraft (FCA) programme. Beyond the FCA programme, equipment such as electronic warfare jammers, additional AEW&C and C4ISR aircraft, air defence assets and radars will likely be given priority in the near-term as Turkey looks with increasing unease along its borders.</p><p>Defence procurement is used by Turkey as a tool for industrial development and while immediate needs may be fulfilled as outright purchases, longer term acquisitions are aimed at ensuring that the government meets its target of defence self-sufficiency by 2023.</p><p>Learn more about Jane''s Defence Budgets or get in touch for more information.</p>', 'https://ihsmarkit.com/research-analysis/turkeys-defence-budget.html');

It has a payload capacity of 68 kg and an operating endurance of up to 8 hours when using standard military batteries.</p><p>The Centaur UGV features a newly developed chassis that is intended to support a high level of mobility. Noticeably, the vehicle does not feature a set of flippers to aid in climbing over obstacles, according to the company this is because the newly developed chassis design offers a high level of mobility.</p><p>Centaur can self-deploy from a marsupial vehicle-mounted system known as the Robotic Deployment System (RDS), a unit that fits onto the outside of vehicles and that can also recover the UGV. This is a newly developed technology which has not previously been deployed. RDS is a US Army-developed system that ensures that an operator can remain in the safety of their vehicle during a mission.</p><p>Centaur’s software was developed using an open architecture framework that is based upon the US Army’s Interoperability Profile and ROS middleware. The controller’s software was developed by the US Army and integrated with the system by Endeavor Robotics.</p><p>Endeavor Robotics is the sole recipient of the MTRS Inc II contract, which according to Bielat is initially worth USD100 million, with an option for an additional USD59 million. Deliveries are due to commence in 2019.</p><p>The US Army currently intends to field 1,200-1,300 platforms over the course of the contract. A small number will be built and delivered for a period of testing. Large-scale acquisition will then begin, with all systems to be delivered over approximately five years.</p><p>Significance of the new technologies:</p><p>The MTRS II program is one of a number of programmes that have been developed to transform and define the future operations of the US Army’s unmanned ground systems fleet.</p><p>The rapid introduction and deployment of various different types of robots in Afghanistan (to meet urgent operational requirements), all with varying functionality and missions or applications had led to a number of issues with communication, operability and dependence on proprietary hardware and software.</p><p>By creating these new robotic programs, the new platforms will be streamlined with a common chassis, controller and so on which will enable the systems to not only be interoperable but have increased modularity and be able to incorporate new sensors, capabilities, payloads and updates with ease. This will ensure that new payloads that are introduced will not be tied to the original equipment manufacturer and will therefore address obsolescence issues. In addition to this, their reliability will be significantly improved.</p><p>The MTRS Increment II offering will be the US Army’s medium-sized UGV that will provide a stand-off capability to detect, identify and neutralize explosive hazards for engineering battalions and CBRNE and Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) units.</p><p>This is an extract from an article that first appeared in Jane’s International Defence Review.</p>', 'https://ihsmarkit.com/research-analysis/us-armys-new-robotic-unmanned-ground-vehicle-revealed.html');

It analyses the Hwaseong-15 (also known as ‘Hwasong-15’) intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) launched by North Korea in November 2017.</p><p>Writing for Jane’s, Schiller and Hansen assess that “it is highly likely that North Korea made use of foreign knowledge, technology or hardware in the development of the Hwaseong-15 ICBM.”</p><p>The November launch attracted international media attention, after North Korea’s state news agency claimed that the missile was “capable of striking the whole mainland of the United States.” It capped a year in which North Korea’s ballistic missile programme made a series of unprecedented advances. Most recently, on 8 February, North Korea displayed what appeared to be four Hwaseong-15 missiles during a military parade in Pyongyang. </p><p>“Given the limited time and test resource available to North Korea, it is highly unlikely that North Korea could design, develop, engine test and integrate the components into … intercontinental missile systems without external assistance,” the report notes.</p><p>Moreover, it is likely that this knowledge, technology or hardware was derived from the Soviet-era ballistic missile programme. According to the report, “the design of the Hwaseong-15 missile is similar in some respects to the Soviet UR-100 family and there is a clear resemblance between the Hwaseong-15 first-stage engine and the Soviet RD-250 engine.”</p><p>However, based on the information available in open sources, Jane’s cannot assess with any confidence when this transfer took place. “The UR-100 family of missiles and the RD-250 engine have been in existence for decades,” said Neil Ashdown, deputy editor of Jane’s Intelligence Review.</p><p>“North Korea could have acquired information about them from a range of sources, including some available online,” Ashdown said. “Even if North Korea did acquire hardware relating to these systems, we cannot say with any confidence where that would have come from, and more importantly when. That does not mean a transfer did not take place -- just that we cannot prove that based on the information we have.”</p><p>The report notes that the Hwaseong-15 had not been seen in open sources before it was first launched in November 2017, and that in key respects, it differs from previously observed North Korean missiles. This suggests that North Korea has pursued multiple lines of development in its ballistic missile programme.</p><p>Moreover, the successful integration of a higher-energy liquid propellant engine into the Hwaseong-15 with minimal observed testing suggests that North Korea could do the same with another missile. This raises the possibility that there may be further, as yet undisclosed, liquid propellant systems in development, which may emerge over the course of 2018.</p><p>*Markus Schiller is a space technology analyst and CEO of ST Analytics.

Areas targeted for growth in FY19 reflect the administration’s stated strategy to “get ready, get balanced and get bigger and more lethal.”</p><p>DoD growth areas:</p><p>Soldiers, Sailors, Marines and Airmen: The PBR requests an increase of 24,900 Soldiers, Sailors, Marines and Airmen for Active Duty and Reserve Component purposes as measured from FY18 levels to the FY19 PBR requested level. The request includes a 2.6% increase in military pay levels - the largest pay increase in nine years.</p><p>Aircraft: The Army is requesting funds to procure 135 Helicopters and 210 UAVs (or ‘drones’) in FY19; the Navy and Marine Corps team is requesting funds to procure 120 Aircraft (including three MQ-4C Triton (BAMS) UAS systems); and the Air Force is requesting funds to procure 88 Aircraft and 78 UAVs in FY19.</p><p>Missile defense: Through the DoD’s Planning, Programming, Budgeting and Execution (PPBE) process and FY18 Emergency Budget Amendments for Missile Defeat and Defense Enhancement responding to the missile threat, missile defense funding is expected to grow from $7.9 billion to a $9.9 billion request in FY19 to ensure a focus on layered defenses for the US and its Allies. If funded to this level, that would represent a 25.3% increase in missile defense funding.</p><p>The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) request of $9.9 billion would fund high priority Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) programs, which include the MDA/Navy Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense program for Aegis cruisers and destroyers and SM-3 missiles, the MDA/Army Terminal High Altitude Air Defense (THAAD) System for US and Allies, and the MDA/Army Ground Missile Defense Mid-course (GMD) program to intercept and destroy incoming Inter-Continental Ballistic Missiles (ICBMs) launched at the US.</p><p>Space: To ensure the space capabilities of resilience, reconstitution and continuity of operations, DoD is investing in satellites for communications, Positioning, Navigation & Timing (PNT), persistent overhead IR, missile warning and space launch programs supporting operations in a contested space environment.</p><p>Naval shipbuilding: Continued Shipbuilding & Conversion, Navy (SC,N) account increases over last three years and increased new construction shipbuilding over time have moved the Navy closer to its future ship target of 355 Battle Force ships by the early 2050s.

Additionally, many of those imprisoned for providing support to groups like the Islamic State in the past two years will probably be released between 2019 and 2023, according to data analyzed by JTIC.</p><p>Key findings of the report</p><p>Violent radicalization of existing Islamist networks</p><p>In addition to the immediate and direct security threat posed by returning foreign fighters, a significant risk is likely to emerge through their potential to transform and radicalize existing Europe-based Islamist networks.</p><p>“Foreign fighters are likely to hold substantial credibility in Islamist networks that are already prone to support groups like the Islamic State,” Iho said. “Their input and leadership could plausibly move groups that have previously held a supportive role – financing, facilitating travel, spreading propaganda – to adopt an operational one: setting up cells, acquiring weapons, providing facilities and safe houses for explosives building, and recruiting militants for attacks in Europe.”</p><p></p><p>Returning foreign fighters to enhance attack capabilities</p><p>‘Low-capability’ attacks, including crude improvised explosive device (IED) attacks, vehicle-impact attacks using rented or stolen trucks and vans, knife and (in a limited number of cases) small-arms attacks are likely to continue, employed primarily by individuals or small cells.</p><p>“Foreign fighters returning to Europe will provide critical skills that will help an increasing number of operational Islamist networks conduct more complex attacks,” Iho said. “These skills include the construction of viable IEDs - learned in Iraq and Syria where the Islamic State has produced IEDs on an industrial scale - expertise in assault weapons, and the use of new weapons types or technologies such as drones.”</p><p>The successful use of car bombs or suicide attack car bombs by Islamist militants on European soil would mark a notable increase in the threat level. There are indicators that some cells have already attempted to adopt this method, including the perpetrators of the August 2017 attack in Barcelona, Spain. Returned militants will increase the likelihood of the successful execution of such an attack, due to relevant skills learned within the Islamic State’s ‘Caliphate’.</p><p>Counter-terrorism challenges</p><p>JTIC’s analysis of European prison sentencing reveals that between 2019 and 2023, a substantial number of terrorism convicts who have been active supporters of Islamist militant groups but in most cases have not taken action to plot or conduct attacks in-country, will be released from prison. As foreign fighters return and militant Islamist activity continues, this trend is likely to accelerate.</p><p>“Though it is too early to make definitive conclusions based on available data of returned foreign fighters, harsh sentencing practices in host countries do not necessarily appear to be a significant disincentive for foreign fighters returning from Iraq and Syria,” Iho said. “The UK is an example of this trend, where despite ample precedent and prison sentences for returnees, it has the highest number of returned militants in Europe with around half having come back,” Iho said. “For those returnees planning on engaging in violence, the symbolic target value of Western European countries perhaps outweighs the higher likelihood of being apprehended and imprisoned.”</p><p></p><p>Since the 2015 attacks in Paris, counter-terrorism legislation across Europe has been harmonized substantially, and on a legislative level most countries are equipped to deal with returnees in a ‘hard’ manner i.e. imprison those who have committed terrorism offences or pose a clear security risk. In practice, however, enforcement of these laws varies somewhat from country to country based on their experience of terrorism: countries such as the Nordics, which have had lower terrorism exposure, tend to have more lenient sentencing.</p><p>About Jane’s Terrorism and Insurgency Centre (JTIC)</p><p>Jane’s Terrorism and Insurgency Centre (JTIC) by IHS Markit uses open source data to build its global database of both attacks by non-state armed groups, in addition to counter-terrorism operations and key statements by state and non-state actors. The database enables users to search by location, target, group (active and dormant), tactics and casualty numbers in order to quickly obtain actionable intelligence and/or data.

Nicholas Blanford and Jonathan Spyer assess whether a wider regional conflict is in the making.</p><p>Key points</p><p>The war in Syria is entering a less intensive phase. This has placed a spotlight on Iran’s apparent ambition to establish a long-term military presence in Syria that would include operating bases, commanding pro-Tehran militias, and establishing a foothold in the Golan Heights opposite Israeli forces – a ‘red line’ for Israel. Anticipating Iran’s military consolidation in Syria, Israel has increased and expanded its airstrikes against suspected Hizbullah targets in Syria to include facilities allegedly connected to Iran.</p><p>Furthermore, the administration of US President Donald Trump has begun to implement a new strategy against Iran and its regional proxies. Measures include Washington’s potential unilateral withdrawal from the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) nuclear agreement; further sanctions on Iranian individuals and entities; and attempts to curb Iran’s ballistic missile programme. In Saudi Arabia, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman appears to be in concert with the White House in seeking to block Iranian ambitions: in November, Riyadh precipitated a political crisis in Lebanon in a bid to force the Beirut government to adopt a stronger line against Hizbullah.</p><p>The drawing down of the Syria war and escalating anti-Hizbullah measures across the region have raised concerns in Lebanon that another war between Hizbullah and Israel could be imminent. In October, sources close to Hizbullah told Jane’s that it had begun to withdraw some of its fighters from Syria, including its special forces units, partly due to the reduction in active fronts but also to shore up the front against Israel in case of a sudden deterioration. The sources said that the level of expectation among Hizbullah cadres that another war was imminent had not been higher since the last conflict in July–August 2006.</p><p>Despite the unsettling dynamics, however, the balance of deterrence between Israel and Hizbullah remains strong. This weighs against either side deliberately launching a war. The month-long but inconclusive war in 2006 set the stage for a potential further round of conflict, but since then the Lebanon-Israel border area has remained calm for the longest continuous period since the 1960s – even as both sides make preparations for a future clash. Moreover, the risk of miscalculation upsetting the delicate balance has grown as various actors in Syria seek to consolidate influence.</p><p>This is an extract from an article that appeared in Jane’s Intelligence Review.

Rising capability requirements are also spurring a high level of corporate competition, with military aerospace manufacturers from all corners of the world looking to expand regional market share.</p><p>According to Jane’s Defence Budgets, total defence investment funding (comprising defence procurement and research and development spending) in Southeast Asia during the 2018–2022 period will be nearly $40 billion, with around $13 billion -- or 33 percent -- spent on air forces. Navies will receive 30 percent of the investment funding, while armies will be allocated about 25 percent, with the remainder directed to cross-force priorities.</p><p>Jane’s statistics also show that Singapore will be Southeast Asia’s biggest air force investor, allocating about $4.2 billion during 2018–2022, or 34 percent of total regional air force modernisation funds during this timeframe.

He cited as “growing threats” China and Russia: two countries that have ramped up naval operations and squared off against US naval forces in recent years.</p><p>USN patrol aircraft and ships have had confrontations in the skies and on the seas with their Chinese counterparts in the Western Pacific and with Russian aircraft in places like the Black Sea.</p><p>Over the long term, the NDS summary said, the best way to thwart such ambitions is to develop a strong military relationship between the United States and China that will lead to “transparency and non-aggression”.</p><p>The US service in the forefront of such a relationship has been the USN, which has worked with Chinese naval forces in joint exercises and drills and arranged port calls in both countries for the two navies’ warships. The two navies have also participated in multinational search-and-rescue missions and humanitarian aid operations.</p><p>Naval strategy to focus on increasing lethality</p><p>While the NDS supports relationship building, it also calls for the development of a more lethal force. As Mattis said, “Everything we do must contribute to the lethality of our military.”</p><p>Such thinking echoes the “distributed lethality” concept the USN has been developing for its surface-ship fleet; the service wants to arm as many ships as it can with missiles that have greater range and destructive force than the weaponry currently available on those ships. Even amphibious ships traditionally used for US Marine Corps (USMC) transportation are being eyed for offensive missile loads.</p><p>Meanwhile, the NDS’ call to modernize US nuclear forces is very much a USN priority with the development of the Columbia class of ballistic missile submarines to replace the existing Ohio-class boats, while the investment focus on “layered missile defenses and disruptive capabilities for both theater missile threats and North Korean ballistic missile threats” more than touches upon the USN’s Aegis combat system upgrades and interceptor improvements for US ballistic missile defense.</p><p>In the wake of recent collisions and mishaps at sea, USN reports have shown that a lack of proper maintenance and a high, prolonged operational tempo that keeps ships out at sea longer than they should be has contributed to an atmosphere ripe for such incidents.

Jon Grevatt reports</p><p>The nature of perceived threats in Southeast Asia is predominately territorial, with China’s military rise and its growing ability to press its claims to most of the South China Sea causing concern about the region’s future stability. As a result Southeast Asian countries have started to invest more in modernising their air capabilities.</p><p>Countries in the region that have territorial disputes with Beijing do not go as far as identifying China as a threat, which would risk jeopardising critical trade ties. However, the fact is that developing air capability is now a priority in Southeast Asia as part of unstated efforts to develop a deterrent and protect exclusive economic zones (EEZ) in the face of rising Chinese assertiveness.</p><p>Even regional countries that are not claimants to territory in the South China Sea, such as Myanmar, Singapore, and Thailand, have identified a requirement to modernise air forces to prepare for scenarios in which potential conflict – resulting from regional instability – could feasibly ‘spill over’ into neighbouring territories.</p><p>Although this threat is prompting investment in capabilities such as multirole combat aircraft, fixed- and rotary-wing transport aircraft, and surveillance and detection assets, the continuing requirement in pockets of Southeast Asia to address insurgency has led to some regional air forces also placing emphasis on light attack and transport assets that can support mainly land forces in counter-insurgency (COIN) operations. Another important role is disaster relief, which has also meant a continuing high demand for logistics and transport assets.</p><p>The Southeast Asian emphasis on air force modernisation is also indicated by defence spending trends. According to Jane’s Defence Budgets (JDB), Southeast Asian countries (comprising Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam) will spend more on air force modernisation during 2012–21 than they will spend on naval and land forces.</p><p>Total defence procurement and research and development (R&D) spending during that timeframe across the region will be about USD69 billion, with USD23 billion – or 33% – spent on air forces. Navies will receive 29% of the procurement and R&D funding, while armies will be allocated about 27%, with the remainder allocated to defence-wide activities.</p><p></p><p>A Republic of Singapore Air Force Boeing CH-47SD Chinook lifts off for a training mission during Exercise ‘Wallaby 2015’. Singapore announced in November 2016 that it would procure additional numbers of the type.</p><p>The JDB statistics also show, perhaps unsurprisingly, that Singapore will be the region’s biggest spender on air force development. According to JDB the government of Singapore will allocate to the Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF) modernisation funds of about USD6.6 billion during 2012–21, or 30% of total regional spending during this timeframe. Singapore’s modernisation expenditure is nearly double that of Vietnam, which is expected to spend USD3.4 billion on its air force during this period (15% of regional air force spending). Following this are the Philippines (spending USD2.8 billion, or 13% of regional air force expenditure), Thailand (USD2.6 billion, or 12%), Indonesia (USD2.5 billion, or 11%), and Malaysia (USD1.9 billion, or 9%).

Key components of this long-range surveillance are over-the-horizon radars and an increasing number of satellites providing electro-optical, infrared, and radar imagery, as well as platform location from intercepted transmissions.</p><p>These capabilities are complemented by shorter-range platforms and sensors, which provide coverage from the coast to the First Island Chain and – in some cases – beyond. As with long-range surveillance, they are also growing in number and capabilities.</p><p>In common with most coastal nations in peacetime, China perceives a need to monitor closely the activities of ships and aircraft from other states operating in the approaches to its coast, specifically within the First Island Chain. From a Chinese perspective, the situation is made more challenging by the proximity of neighbouring countries (notably Japan and South Korea) that have close military relationships with the US.</p><p></p><p>China has constructed a number of over-the-horizon (OTH) radars that exploit the propagation of electromagnetic waves at certain high frequencies (HF) as surface waves, which follow the curvature of the earth. Performance will depend upon atmospheric conditions, but it is estimated that these OTH (SW) radars are likely to provide coverage out to 300–400 km over an arc of 60 degrees. China also operates OTH radars that exploit the backscattering of transmissions from the ionosphere for surveillance up to 3,500 km.</p><p>Although the OTH (SW) radar sites were constructed 10 or more years ago, much of the remainder of China’s short-range surveillance capabilities has been considerably enhanced since 2012. Previous capability gaps are being plugged and the number of ISR platforms in service can be expected to increase during the next five years.

These figures represented a slight 9 percent increase in attacks – but a more substantial 40 percent decrease in resultant fatalities. In proportional terms, Islamic State attacks in 2017 accounted for 21 percent of all attacks worldwide, an increase from 18 percent in 2016.</p><p>“The overall trend of Islamic State attacks slightly increasing and fatalities decreasing substantially was representative of the operational shift undertaken by the group across the year as a consequence of steady territorial losses - most notably the cities of Mosul and Raqqa - which continued until the final capture of all territory controlled in Iraq and Syria in early November,” Henman said. “As it came under growing territorial pressure, the Islamic State transitioned back to insurgent operations, conducting a higher tempo of low intensity violence against security forces and non-state adversaries in areas newly recaptured from the group.”</p><p>There also was a reduction in external operations by the Islamic State targeting Western nations, with no evidently centrally-directed and executed attack in 2017, such as Paris in November 2015 and Brussels in March 2016. However, there were multiple attacks for which the group claimed responsibility that were conducted by suspected supporters of the group. These included the 22 May suicide attack in the UK city of Manchester, killing 22; the 17 August vehicle-impact attack in Barcelona, Spain, killing 14; and two combined vehicle-impact and knife attacks in the UK capital London on 22 March and 3 June, killing a total of 13.</p><p>2018 outlook</p><p>As the Islamic State looks to regroup in Syria and Iraq and maintain its operational threat through a combination of low-level insurgent operations and periodic asymmetric mass-casualty attacks, the group will continue to exhort its supporters worldwide to continue to launch attacks in their home countries.</p><p>“This will particularly be the case in those states that participated in the US-led coalition against the group in Iraq and Syria, with the group utilizing a potent narrative of revenge for the territorial destruction of the group’s self-declared caliphate and for the civilians and fighters killed in its defense,” Henman said. “Operationally, it is likely that these attacks will continue to follow the same patterns as in 2016 and 2017, such as vehicle-impact and edged weapon attacks, although the use of homemade improvised explosive devices (IEDs) remains a strong if less likely possibility.”</p><p>The upcoming World Cup in Russia in June likely presents a particularly attractive target for the Islamic State, given Russia’s role in the group’s territorial defeat in addition to the participation of the Saudi and Iranian national teams.</p><p>“A successful attack would provide a tremendous propaganda boost for the Islamic State and its fighters and supporters, underlining the ongoing international threat posed by the group despite its territorial defeat,” Henman said. “While security will be extremely high across the course of the tournament, low-capability attacks by lone actors with no evident markers of radicalization remain extremely difficult to identify preemptively and there remains a substantial risk of an attack successfully being conducted.”</p><p>About the JTIC Global Attack Index report</p><p>The JTIC dataset, used to generate the incident and trend analysis in this report, is compiled using reliable open-source intelligence (OSINT) collated from a comprehensive range of local, national, and international sources; government and inter-governmental reports; and analytical articles.

For example, in that most obvious manifestation of superpower status – the projection of air power from the sea – China has this year not only continued to work up the combat capabilities of its first aircraft carrier, the Ukrainian-built Liaoning, but on 26 April launched its first domestically produced carrier, known as the Type 001A: the largest ever warship built in a Chinese shipyard.</p><p>In November, Rear Admiral Yin Zhuo, director of the PLA Navy’s expert consultation committee, claimed that “thousands of take-offs” have been conducted by J-15 carrier-borne fighters using an electromagnetic launch system expected to be accommodated within the country’s second indigenously built carrier, commonly referred to as the Type 002 – placing the PLA Navy on a technological par with the US Navy and its new Ford carrier class.</p><p>More generally, Pentagon officials have identified that China is now pursuing a range of advanced weapons with disruptive military potential, including manoeuvrable re-entry vehicles, hypersonic weapons, directed-energy weapons, electromagnetic railguns, counter-space weapons, and unmanned and artificial intelligence-equipped weapons.</p><p>With such an unprecedented break-out occurring in Chinese military technical capabilities, the US military is now firmly regarding China as a near-peer competitor in terms of the military might it can bring to bear.</p><p>Russia plays winning hand in geopolitics</p><p>Turning to Russia, President Vladimir Putin has this year once again proved himself to be a consummate geopolitical poker player.

"However, defence spending remains lower in relation to GDP than at any time in the last 10 years, which suggests that recent growth primarily relates to improved economic and fiscal conditions in established markets."</p><p>Over the last decade, global defence expenditure has fallen from an average level of 2.7 percent of GDP to 2.2 percent.</p><p>US raises defence spend under Trump </p><p>The key reason for the expected acceleration in global defence spending growth is the potential 4.7 percent increase to the US budget planned for 2018.</p><p>With the US Department of Defense''s (DoD) budget accounting for 40 percent of all global defence expenditure, changes in US spending affect trends worldwide. Since the 11 September attacks in 2001, the US has spent around $10 trillion on defence.</p><p>"President Trump and his administration sought large increases in the DoD budget in his first budget. The increased funding will go toward fixing readiness and training issues that are largely the result of sequestration cuts," said Guy Eastman, senior analyst, Jane''s by IHS Markit.

The trend has steadily reversed since then and regional defence spending is expected to increase by 1.3 percent in 2018.</p><p>"Defence spending growth in Western Europe will largely be driven stabilising government balance sheets, the perceived threat from Russia on NATO''s eastern border, and several key procurement programmes coming online." McGerty said. "However, this growth will hinge on political developments in the region. Not least, the outcome of German coalition discussions and the bearing this will have on European defence cooperation as well the progress of Brexit negotiations and the resulting impact on the economic outlook of the UK and its trading partners."</p><p>Eastern Europe sees fastest defence spending growth</p><p>Eastern Europe will be the fastest growing region in the world in 2018 as several countries pursue the goal to increase defence spending to 2 percent of GDP. Growth has been particularly spectacular among the three Baltic States. By next year, Baltic defence spending will have more than doubled in real terms compared to 2014 levels and Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania will all be spending 2 percent of GDP or more on defence.</p><p>"Growth has taken off in Eastern Europe since Russia''s intervention in Ukraine in 2014 with the majority of the new defence funding being put towards military modernisation," McGerty said. "Armoured vehicle procurement is on the increase - in fact, Europe is emerging as the leading spender globally in the military ground vehicle market."</p><p>Russian defence expenditure fell for a second consecutive year in 2017 as Moscow continued to grapple with challenging economic and fiscal conditions.</p><p>"The defence budget is now around 10 percent lower than its 2015 peak and is expected to be reduced by a further 5 percent next year. Russian military modernisation will continue but the cuts are impacting the pace of that process," said Craig Caffrey, principal analyst, Jane''s by IHS Markit.</p><p>APAC spending slows but return to growth expected </p><p>Growth in Asia-Pacific - a region that has experienced robust growth over the last decade - slowed this year to its lowest rate since 2010 due to smaller increases in China and India and cuts to spending in South East Asia.</p><p>"While we saw a distinct slowdown in 2017, the foundations remain in place for robust increases to return over the next two years. We still expect Asia-Pacific to be behind the driving force behind long term growth in global defence spending," Caffrey said.</p><p>"Economic growth is still the main factor behind rising spending in Asia-Pacific but we''re starting to see strategic factors play a more prominent role. In recent years Chinese actions in the East and South China Sea, the North Korean ballistic missile threat and insurgencies throughout South East Asia have all caused additional funding to be diverted towards defence," Caffrey said.</p><p>Middle East returns to growth due to geopolitical challenges  </p><p>Following a reduction in 2016, defence spending returned to growth in the Middle East and North Africa this year. Crucially, Saudi Arabia - the largest defence spender in the region - increased its defence budget in 2017 after cutting spending the previous year.</p><p>"Fiscal consolidation is still occurring in a number of key states in the region following the collapse in oil prices; however the challenging security environment has seen defence budgets protected from cuts in most cases.

These range from the ongoing conflict in Yemen, to the continued influence of Iran, and ongoing conflict in Syria and Iraq.</p><p>This extract from the Jane''s Intelligence Briefing series examines the security challenges and provide a useful update on the security, budgetary, and industrial trends in the region. Content from this extract has been taken from a range of Jane''s defence industry solutions.</p><p>Regional security environment</p><p>One of the main issues today regarding regional security and risk is the operations that GCC countries are currently involved in. The operations tempo, particularly for Air Forces, has seen the countries undertake missions in Syria and Iraq against Islamic State, and combined operations against Houthi rebels in Yemen.</p><p>With these conflicts there is the risk of conflict overspill, which is a real concern for countries such as Oman and Saudi Arabia in the south and the north. For other countries, there is also the risk of being targeted by Islamic State cells, as was seen by the bombing of a Shia mosque in Kuwait in 2015.</p><p>Iran is also an ongoing security threat for the GCC countries, with a ballistic missile threat, and nuclear weapons programme driving strategic thinking for these countries. In addition, Iran has the potential to increase unrest in Shia areas of eastern Saudi Arabia and Bahrain.</p><p></p><p>Islamic State</p><p>Islamic State has also been a key threat within the region to date, but is now being pushed back. This map from June shows how the group had, according to IHS Markit analysis, been pushed back to an estimated area of 36,200 square kilometres, which is roughly the size of Belgium or the US State of Maryland. This marks a 60% decline in controlled territory since the first estimate of 90,800 square kilometres in January 2015, and a 40% decline since the start of the year.</p><p></p><p>In a sense, the battle against Islamic State has brought a range of new challenges for both Western and regional militaries. This can be seen through increased sophistication in IEDs, for example, but also the use of UAVs in both surveillance and combat roles. In Yemen, unmanned surface vessels have also begun to appear as a threat to shipping, as well as non-state actor use of advanced systems like anti-ship missiles and ballistic missiles.</p><p>Political challenges</p><p>Succession remains a concern, with power transition potentially causing issues internally and externally, as countries may look to decide how they pursue modernisation or development, and what these costs may be. Additionally, there would also be a resulting delay as power transitions to a new leader - something that happens with any country really. Kuwait and Saudi Arabia are both ruled by leaders in their 80s, with Kuwait''s crown prince also in his 80s. Oman''s Sultan Qaboos is 76, and does not appear to have a publicly designated successor.</p><p>Economic and fiscal conditions</p><p>Three years since oil prices began to collapse, the Gulf region is still adjusting to the new reality of low oil prices. Following a boom period between 2011 and 2014 where prices were above $100 a barrel we''ve seen a sustained period of oil at below $60 a barrel. These depressed prices represent the new reality for the major energy producers in the Gulf.</p><p>Defence spending in the Gulf</p><p>Following sustained period of growth over the previous decade or so, we saw defence spending fall by around 3% following cuts in 2015 and 2016 - the first cuts seen since 2008. However the fragile security environment in the region has seen defence spending protected, spending has plateaued rather than been cut. Even though government budgets are still under a lot pressure, tentative growth returned this year and a recovery to pre-oil crash levels is now expected in 2018 or 2019.</p><p>Procurement cycles in Qatar</p><p>Qatar is really the standout country in terms of its attempts to increase capabilities. The procurement cycles in Qatar and Kuwait have supported the Gulf defence market since the oil price crashed. Since mid-2014, Qatar has finalised over USD20 billion worth of deals and as a result the navy will double in size, the air force may well treble in size. A massive expansion of their military and one which will require higher levels of defence spending going forward to support it.</p><p>Industrial consolidation</p><p>One of the first things to note in the region has been the emergence of defence industrial consolidation, with the two countries with major defence industrial ambitions - the UAE and Saudi - being the main ones involved. In the UAE, the creation of the Emirates Defence Industries Company, or EDIC, was seen as a way to bring together the country''s various defence industrial holdings into one organisation.</p><p>Procurement processes - rise of the smart buyer</p><p>One of the things that appears to be emerging out of the UAE and Saudi in particular is the potential rise of the "smart buyer" - a shift away from procuring platforms to procuring capability, which includes the TLS package. As a result, there may be increased options to leverage greater work on MRO for domestic industry, which may be a problem for services firms such that focus on TLS and logistics. That said, OEM partnering with companies that can offer a lower cost TLS solution may be a way forward - and there may be some secondary offset success in that regard.</p><p>Iran - the future wildcard?</p><p>With arms sanctions set to be lifted in 2020, there''s the possibility of it opening up as a market, and some suppliers are already considering it. The country has some broad modernisation requirements ranging from aircraft to armour, and joint equipment. Combat aviation is already a key area of focus, with Russian firms already looking to export there.</p><p>The country possesses some fairly solid strengths, born out of the experience of the past decade, in areas such as UAVs, rockets, and missiles, to name a few.</p><p>Jane''s runs a series of 40 intelligence briefings throughout the year which are accessible to subscribers to Jane''s intelligence centres and modules.

Jane''s examines some of the factors surrounding the digital revolution that will dictate whether nation-states maintain an informational advantage over their adversaries.</p><p>This is an extract from an article from Jane''s Intelligence Review</p><p>Key points:</p><p>For states, intelligence collection and analysis have an overarching objective: to maintain informational superiority over an adversary. Yet the ability of a state to maintain that advantage - over competitors and even its own citizenry - is no longer assured. The exponential pace of the digital revolution has already had a profound effect on how intelligence agencies and law enforcement operate. It has consigned much of the Cold War-era tradecraft to history as technological capabilities shift power away from governments and towards commercial companies and individuals, or create new realities in inter-state competition.</p><p>The digital revolution brings both threats and opportunities to the intelligence community. Recognising the pace of change, it has begun to adapt and innovate. In 2015, the CIA under former director John Brennan launched a new Directorate of Digital Innovation. According to David Ignatius writing in The Washington Post on 9 April 2015, this change reflected the CIA''s recognition that, "Every aspect of intelligence, including covert action, recruiting agents and protecting officers'' covers, is now linked to information technology."</p><p></p><p>Caption: Examples of trends around the digital revolution and their impact on the intelligence cycle (© 2017 IHS Markit/Getty images)</p><p>On 20 September 2016, Alex Younger, the head of the UK''s Secret Intelligence Service (SIS, or MI6) - which aims to recruit up to 1,000 new personnel by 2020 to address digital challenges - said, "The information revolution fundamentally changes our operating environment. In five years'' time, there will be two sorts of intelligence services: those that understand this fact and have prospered, and those that don''t and haven''t."</p><p>Nevertheless, the pace of change threatens to outstrip often slow-moving and change-resistant state agencies. Multiple disruptive new technologies will come on-stream in the coming decade that will have profound implications for their operations, and commercial companies will build capabilities that exceed those of all but the most advanced states. Digitally empowered citizens will test their governments'' informational superiority.</p><p>As advanced technologies proliferate, old and formerly clear delineations within intelligence work are likely to be strained in many ways: between the different intelligence disciplines such as human intelligence (HUMINT) and signals intelligence (SIGINT); between the practices of collection and analysis; between foreign and domestic intelligence; and between online and real-world personas.</p><p>Many changes by 2030 will not be directly technological. Other trends will inform a shifting security environment, such as the demographic ascendancy of the computer-literate millennial generation, rapid urbanisation within megacities, increasing popular scepticism about the state monopolies of power, and the transition to a service-based knowledge economy.</p><p>Nevertheless, technology is set to be the pre-eminent driver of change, and this will occur within a context of multiple emerging systems. Cryptocurrencies and blockchain technologies will challenge the established global financial system; US primacy in space-based technologies will face challenges from the rise of genuine state peers, most notably China - which is pursuing advanced earth observation capabilities and promoting alternative navigation and communication systems - as well as from private companies taking advantage of reduced technological and financial barriers to entry to place their own satellite constellations into orbit; and the nature of the internet itself is likely to change with differing conceptions about its operation and regulation.</p><p>This is an extract from an article that appeared in Jane''s Intelligence Review.

However, once the government has re-established control over Deir al-Zour''s oil fields and population centres along the Euphrates, it will probably no longer adhere to the de-escalation zones plan in the west. President Bashar al-Assad has consistently stated that he intends to re-assert government control over all Syrian territory, and he likely calculates that he is now in a position to do so.</p><p></p><p>Syrian government territorial gains between 21 September 2015 and 20 November 2017 ©2017 IHS Markit</p><p>The government''s likely priorities in the coming months will be to establish control over the country''s main Damascus-Homs-Aleppo highway and to re-open the border crossings with Jordan and Iraq to trade. The remaining smaller pockets of insurgent control around Damascus and Homs are likely to be returned to government control over the coming year, either by negotiation or by force.</p><p>The future status of Deir al-Zour''s oil fields</p><p>The US-backed, predominantly Kurdish, Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) took control of the al-Omar and al-Tanak oil fields in Deir al-Zour province in October, amid unverified claims that they had negotiated a handover of the fields with Islamic State-affiliated tribesmen. If reports of Islamic State fighters defecting to the SDF are correct - which IHS Markit assesses are plausible - these were probably local tribal components of the Islamic State, rather than more ideologically committed foreign fighters. Faced with inevitable defeat, they preferred the oil fields to fall into the hands of the SDF, rather than the Syrian government.</p><p>The government will almost certainly prioritise recovery of the al-Omar and other fields from the SDF in the coming months. Russian efforts have accelerated since early October to co-ordinate between Damascus and Kurdish representatives, which reportedly resulted in the SDF handing over the Conoco gas facility in northern Deir al-Zour province to the Syrian army on 18 October. Failing a negotiated handover of the other fields, the government''s most likely course of action would be to announce that they are reclaiming them by force. We assess that US-backed Kurdish components of the SDF would withdraw from the fields in that event, probably as part of a wider agreement to initiate negotiations on autonomy for the Kurds. Sunni Arab tribal components of the SDF and defected Islamic State tribesmen would be more likely to resist the government militarily.</p><p>Demands for Kurdish autonomy in northern Syria</p><p>President Assad has made it clear that he will not accept the splitting of the Syrian state, and will demand that territory currently held by the SDF, including the city of Raqqa, reverts to government control. The Syrian government and the de facto Kurdish administration will most likely try to avoid military conflict over this territory. The Kurds have very little incentive to sacrifice more Kurdish lives for traditionally Sunni territory that they have no realistic expectation of permanently holding, and the Syrian government will not want to become engaged concurrently in fighting Syrian Kurds and the existing Sunni insurgency in western Syria. Our assessment is that the most likely outcome will be a negotiated handover of territory that the Kurds seized from the Islamic State back to the Syrian government, in return for some degree of Kurdish autonomy within the Syrian national state.</p><p>The Syrian government appears willing to grant the Kurds some autonomy within the existing state framework. In September, the state news agency SANA quoted Syria''s foreign minister, Walid al-Moualem, as saying that the government was open to negotiations with the Kurds over a deal for greater autonomy within the borders of the Syrian Arab Republic. The Kurdish Democratic Union Party''s (Partiya Yekîtiya Demokrat: PYD) official position is that Syria''s Kurds are looking for federalism, not partition of Syria. Negotiations are likely to be contingent on the SDF returning territory captured from the Islamic State since 2014.</p><p>Turkey''s deployment in support of Sunni opposition in Idlib</p><p>The rebel-held Idlib pocket is the most likely of the designated de-escalation zones in which there could be a significant intensification of fighting once the government has re-established control in Deir al-Zour. The government''s likely main objective in Idlib province will be to re-establish control over the strategically important M5 highway that links the country''s main cities of Damascus, Homs, and Aleppo. This would probably be possible without a direct military confrontation with Turkish forces deployed further to the west, and would leave Turkey to defend the interests of Syria''s Sunni opposition in an area adjacent to its border, which is of low strategic value to the government.</p><p>Turkey''s primary objective in Syria is to prevent the establishment of an autonomous Kurdish entity along its border with Syria. The deployment of Turkish troops to Idlib province in October, which is only likely to have happened with Russian agreement, is aimed at deterring the Syrian government from attempting to retake all of Idlib province. The Syrian government does not have the capability to expel the Turkish army from Idlib province militarily, and will probably be forced into negotiating a deal that will, at a minimum, involve an exclusion of the Afrin canton from Kurdish autonomy, and assurances that the policing of the border with Turkey will be returned from the YPG to government control. It is unlikely that Turkey will be able to prevent an agreement between Damascus and the Kurds, as approved by Russia, and they will probably be presented with a fait accompli, regardless of their objections.</p><p>Israel''s emerging ''red lines'' in Syria</p><p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated on 23 October that preventing Iran from establishing itself militarily in Syria was now Israel''s top strategic priority. Israel is concerned about Iran''s freedom of action to deploy at will not just proxies, but Iranian combat forces, across Syria. There is now a potential front line with Iran on Israel''s borders, and the strategic depth Israel has hitherto enjoyed from its geography has been eroded by the Iranian-supplied missiles available to Iran''s proxies in Syria. For Israel, the expansion of Iran''s influence increases the capability of its enemies to develop high-precision missiles and other advanced weapons in concealed/hardened sites in Syria and south Lebanon, reducing their dependence on land resupply, and the vulnerability of their supply line to interdiction by Israeli air strikes.</p><p>The net result of Iranian expansion increases the risk of a local confrontation with Israel in south Lebanon or the Golan escalating into a war, not just involving proxies but Syrian government, and potentially Iranian, forces. Israel has signalled its displeasure with US and Russian plans to allow the Syrian civil war to end with Iran having substantially expanded its military presence in the country, and is seeking to communicate its new ''red lines'' in Syria. These appear to include a rejection of the presence of any hostile foreign forces west of the Damascus-Dar''a road, approximately 50 km from the Israeli-occupied Golan. Although Hizbullah is likely to respond to Israeli military action in an equivalent manner, Hizbullah will not be the only player, or the only Israeli target, involved and any response carries a risk of unintended escalation.</p><p>About Conflict Monitor</p><p>The content from this blog post is compiled from Conflict Monitor: an open-source intelligence collection and analysis service.

With the recent losses of Deir al-Zour and al-Bukamal in Syria and al-Qaim in Iraq, alongside the final offensive targeting Rawa, the Islamic State will likely cease to be a territorial entity in Iraq and Syria by the end of this month.</p><p>Despite the hope - or perhaps misguided expectation - otherwise, the defeat of the Islamic State as a territorial entity will not represent its defeat as a non-state armed group, nor put a halt to its armed campaign. Instead, the group will almost certainly transition from a pseudo state back to an underground armed insurgency, remaining capable of conducting asymmetric attacks against security forces in Iraq and Syria and continuing to undermine security and central governance.</p><p>Indeed, this process has been underway for the past 12 months at least, as underlined by data recorded by JTIC. Between October 2016 and September 2017, the Islamic State conducted 5,349 attacks worldwide, resulting in a total of 8,139 non-militant fatalities. This represented an interesting change from the preceding 12 months, comprising a 38.3 percent increase in attacks but a 21.8 percent decrease in non-militant fatalities.</p><p>The fact that the Islamic State has been conducting more attacks but causing fewer fatalities is indicative of the group''s transition to asymmetric insurgent operations in areas of Iraq and Syria that have been recaptured from it by state or non-state adversaries. These operational methods mirror the tactics employed by the group''s affiliates in other parts of the world as the Islamic State strives to build the conditions for establishing territorial control.</p><p></p><p>A shadow state </p><p>The Islamic State will seek to maintain some semblance of its former governance structure as a shadow state, imposing summary justice through abductions and executions, and portraying itself as exercising power in areas under government control.</p><p>The continuation of a shadow state campaign is paramount for the Islamic State''s future ambitions, which remain tied to the establishment of a lasting and expanding territorial caliphate. The group has portrayed its losses of territory as part of a drawn-out long-term battle against crusading, apostate forces, and it will aim to retain the capabilities to reorganize a wider campaign in the future to regain the territories that it has lost as well as expand its borders further.</p><p>Conflict enters a new stage </p><p>While the imminent territorial destruction of the Islamic State is an important stage in the ongoing fight against the group, it will mark a new phase of the conflict rather than its terminus.</p><p>The denial of a territorial base for the group from which it can impose its fundamentalist interpretation of Islam on a captive population, stage further territorial expansions, and inspire, facilitate, and conduct operations worldwide has justifiably been the pre-eminent focus of the various ongoing campaigns against the Islamic State.

Similarly, in Syria the future status of the Islamic State''s former capital of Raqqa encapsulates the potential for violence between pro-government forces and Kurdish forces in the vacuum left by the Islamic State''s defeat.</p><p>Without a concentrated and comprehensive ongoing approach to tackling the Islamic State, both directly in its primary operational areas and its indirect influence in the West, there is every chance that the territorial campaigns against the group currently being concluded will have to be refought in the future.</p><p>The content from this blog post is compiled from Jane''s Terrorism and Insurgency Centre.</p><p>To request a demonstration or for more information visit Jane''s Terrorism and Insurgency Centre.</p><p>Matthew Henman, Associate Director of Jane''s Terrorism and Insurgency Centre (JTIC), IHS Markit Posted 17 November 2017</p>', 'https://ihsmarkit.com/research-analysis/territorial-destruction-of-the-islamic-state-will-not-end-ongoing-threat.html');

Jon Grevatt reports</p><p>This is an extract from an article from Jane''s Defence Weekly and is available via Jane''s Defence Equipment and Technology Intelligence Centre.</p><p>Thailand is in the midst of a defence modernisation programme intended to support not only major improvements in the Royal Thai Armed Forces, but also advances in indigenous military-technological capability in line with a government drive to strengthen self-reliance and spur economic growth.</p><p>The interlinked strategy has become a priority for the military-led Thai government, which came to power following a coup d''état in 2014 after years of political instability, including an earlier coup in 2006.</p><p>Since assuming office Thai Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha - who led the 2014 coup as commander of the Royal Thai Army (RTA) - and Deputy Prime Minister Prawit Wongsuwan, who is also defence minister, have been credited with providing significant impetus for Thailand''s modernisation push in terms of the military and defence industry.</p><p>Dr Panitan Wattanayagorn, security advisor to Prawit in his position as deputy prime minister, told Jane''s , "There was a personal commitment from these military people when they came to the civilian office.… They are not afraid of making decisions for the long term and in the military domain they understand what is required a little bit better than civilians. They have that confidence."</p><p>The modernisation strategy is underpinned by a pledge from the government to secure technological capability through every major defence acquisition from abroad. Such an intention was stated by previous governments but only ever implemented in a piecemeal fashion. The signs are promising, however, that Prayut''s administration is on the right track to advance Thailand''s progression up the value chain, with a number of plans in place to leverage military investment in supporting wider industrial development.</p><p>The development programme is supported by two linked and recently published strategic policies: ''Modernisation Plan: Vision 2026'', a programme that outlines overall improvements in the Thai military over the coming decade; and the ''Defence Industry Masterplan'', which provides a plan for industrial modernisation.</p><p>The former does not specify procurement targets but instead highlights ways to improve the preparation of the Thai military, enhance its capabilities, and modernise its related administrative processes and management structures. The latter is geared towards supporting advancement in indigenous capability in key areas and promoting collaboration between foreign suppliers and local industry.</p><p>Spending</p><p>To support modernisation the Vision 2026 plan outlined an objective to allocate up to 2% of gross domestic product (GDP) to defence within the next few years, through which funding will be set aside for major acquisitions. The spending plan also provides for contingencies should this target not be achieved, but it is widely accepted that a higher level of defence expenditure is required to underpin greater emphasis on procurement and related development.</p><p>Panitan said the country''s ability to increase defence spending as a portion of GDP will be a critical factor in future modernisation. "At the moment Thailand allocates less than 1.5% of GDP to defence," he told Jane''s . "This is not very high when compared to others in the region. The ability of the government to increase this military budget will be one of the key drivers of modernisation," he explained.</p><p>Drivers</p><p>Thailand''s military modernisation programme has in the recent past been centred on developing capability across all domains - air, land, and sea - and this focus is expected to continue in light of the country''s diverse strategic threats. These have ranged from drug trafficking in the north to political violence in Bangkok, low-level conflict with Cambodia in the east, tension with Myanmar in the west, and long-running insurgency in the country''s deep south.</p><p>Requirements</p><p>In response to these expanding requirements Thailand has procured a number of major platforms in recent years, but additional investment is clearly required to meet some of the threat scenarios that the country could face in the future.</p><p>Most of the acquisition activity has been in the RTA. Its major orders have included more than 200 BTR-3E1 armoured personnel carriers (APCs) and 49 BM Oplot main battle tanks (MBTs) from Ukraine, with deliveries of the former already fulfilled and the latter scheduled to be complete by the end the year.

This applies not just to platforms, but also the systems and underlying technologies installed on them.</p><p>According to data sourced from Jane''s Balance of Trade , which tracks deliveries of defence equipment, Thailand''s top six military suppliers are China, France, South Korea, Sweden, Ukraine, and the United States. Germany, Israel, Italy, Russia, Singapore, and the United Kingdom all follow, indicating the eclectic range of defence trade partnerships that Thailand maintains. It is also the case that the Thai market has shifted in favour of China, Russia, South Korea, Sweden, and Ukraine during the past decade, while other European countries and the United States have lost ground following an apparent straining of relations in the aftermath of the coup in 2014.</p><p>Defence industry</p><p>Thailand''s defence industry is dominated by a series of factories and facilities owned and operated by the RTA, RTAF, and RTN. Capability is strongest in the land and maritime sectors, where local industry has built several platforms in recent years. These include a range of munitions and firearms as well as more sophisticated systems such as the Atmos 2000 SPH, which was built by the artillery and mortar production division of the RTA''s Weapon Production Centre. Other prominent state-owned enterprises include Bangkok Dock, which is building in partnership with BAE Systems the RTN''s second River-class OPV at the service''s Mahidol Adulyadej Naval Dockyard in Chonburi; and Thai Aviation Industries, which provides maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO) services for most of the RTAF''s assets, including its Lockheed Martin F-16 fighters.</p><p>This is an extract from an article from Jane''s Defence Weekly and is available via Jane''s Defence Equipment and Technology Intelligence Centre.

Richard Scott reports.</p><p>This is an extract from an article from Jane''s Defence Weekly and is available via Jane''s Defence Equipment and Technology Intelligence Centre. </p><p>The aircraft carrier became established as the pre-eminent naval power-projection asset during the Second World War, yet for much of the period since 1945 there has been fierce debate over the military value and cost-effectiveness of organic fixed-wing naval air power.</p><p>Critics have argued long and hard that the high cost associated with carrier construction, workup, operation, and support does not translate in terms of cost or mission effectiveness and that an aircraft carrier consumes disproportionate force structure through its requirement for accompanying escorts and afloat support. Furthermore, the primacy and cost of the carrier may adversely affect investment in other capabilities.</p><p>Cost is not the only stick used to beat the carrier. Some commentators argue that the carrier and its air group are increasingly put at risk by advanced and proliferating anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) threats. They further contend that land-based strike aircraft and long-range cruise missiles represent a viable alternative to the naval air wing, characterising the aircraft carrier as an arcane and potentially vulnerable leviathan in a new age of asymmetric adversaries and cyber warfare.</p><p>However, proponents have remained equally convinced that the carrier and its embarked air group continue to offer a uniquely mobile, flexible, reconfigurable, and truly independent platform for sustained operations at reach. These advocates further claim that the carrier, through its ability to enable the projection of tactical air power independent of access, basing, and overflight rights endures as a ''platform of necessity'' in an era of expeditionary operations where host-nation support may be unavailable or comes with significant political and/or military constraints and risks attached.</p><p>Supporters also contend that the aircraft carrier must be recognised as a political instrument by which to demonstrate diplomatic posture and military resolve. In that sense it can be seen as an embodiment of national prestige - indeed, a mechanism by which to exert political influence on the world stage - as much as a pure instrument of naval power.</p><p>What is undeniable is that the business of generating and sustaining fixed-wing air power from the sea is costly and complex. Much more than just a floating airfield, the aircraft carrier and its embarked air wing only realise their potential from an intricate choreography - blending equipment, manpower, training and rehearsal, organisation, procedure, infrastructure, and doctrine - that must function coherently to deliver a safe and effective capability.</p><p>The air group is the weapon system of the carrier, so the primary metric by which to quantify its output is the sortie generation rate (SGR). This is conditioned by a whole host of interacting factors, including the following: the size of the air group; the number of aircrew; aircraft maintenance intervals; fuelling and preparation on deck; the number of aircraft maintainers or number of aircraft that can be maintained simultaneously; sortie duration; the preparation, delivery, and loading of ordnance on the flight deck; the movement of aircraft between the hangar and flight deck; the positioning and re-positioning of aircraft on the flight deck; launch and recovery cycles; air traffic control; aircrew rest periods and limits on aircrew cumulative flying hours; the number of days that sorties need to be flown; mission pre-briefing and post-briefing time; and underway replenishment at sea.</p><p>Operations must in turn be supported by a comprehensive strike planning and air-management infrastructure. This places significant demands on connectivity and bandwidth and the provision of organic facilities to enable the timely exploitation of intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance feeds.</p><p>Furthermore, the carrier and its air wing do not operate in isolation, but deploy as the centrepiece of a carrier group that will typically also feature anti-air and anti-submarine escorts, as well as afloat support shipping. That group will also require support from a submarine and long-range maritime patrol aircraft.</p><p>Therefore, the big-deck carrier club brings high costs of admission and membership that few navies can afford. Over the past half century Argentina, Australia, Canada, and the Netherlands have all elected to divest, or have found themselves unable to sustain, a carrier capability owing to resource shortfalls and/or material obsolescence.</p><p>Brazil has found itself the latest nation to exit fixed-wing carrier operations, with the Marinha do Brasil announcing in February that it had abandoned plans for the modernisation and service life extension of the carrier Sao Paulo (ex- Foch ). This decision reflected the age and material condition of Sao Paulo and the costs, technical risks, and extended timeframe that would have been associated with the modernisation of a ship that is already more than 55 years old.</p><p>The introduction of navalised short take-off and vertical landing (STOVL) aircraft from the 1970s onwards offered a means by which to take air power to sea - albeit with limitations - without the full costs associated with conventional catapult launch but arrested recovery (CATOBAR) methods. India, Italy, the Soviet Union, Spain, and the United Kingdom all went on to acquire STOVL carriers and air groups.</p><p>Thailand was also briefly a member of the club, having acquired a handful of AV-8S Harrier fighters from Spain in the late 1990s attendant to the procurement of the small carrier Chakri Naruebet . However, these were retired in 2006, leaving Chakri Naruebet operating helicopters only.</p><p>The United Kingdom has found itself devoid of a fixed-wing carrier capability since the retirement of HMS Ark Royal in 2010. With the support of the US and French navies, it is in the midst of regenerating a carrier strike capability with the objective of achieving an initial operational capability (IOC) by the end of 2020.</p><p>China''s People''s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN), meanwhile, has become the latest navy to join the handful that operate large-deck carriers. In common with Russia and India, it has adopted short take-off but arrested recovery (STOBAR) as the operating method for the embarked fixed-wing air group. STOBAR requires aircraft to launch under their own power over a ski-ramp at the end of the flight deck while recovery is performed using arrestor wires.</p><p>This is an extract from an article from Jane''s Defence Weekly and is available via Jane''s Defence Equipment and Technology Intelligence Centre.

Espionage is cost effective and - when conducted well - one of the most effective force multipliers. This is particularly the case for insurgent groups that are usually at a numerical, financial, and technological disadvantage compared with state-based forces. Many insurgent groups are enhancing their ability to collect and act on intelligence.</p><p>Insurgent and militant groups have almost always tasked some of their members with collecting strategic, tactical, and counter-intelligence (CI). Larger and more established groups, such as Hizbullah, have developed well-structured and increasingly formalised intelligence wings that collect and interpret human intelligence (HUMINT) and signals intelligence (SIGINT). Given the level of funding and political reach of such large groups, developing an intelligence wing is a natural evolution.</p><p>Of particular concern to nation-states is how less well-organised and -funded insurgent groups are rapidly developing and refining their intelligence capabilities in ways that contribute to accuracy, adaptability, and resilience. The intelligence wings of these groups, such as Harakat al-Shabaab al-Mujahideen in Somalia and Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) in Yemen, utilise flat networks - with few layers of hierarchy - that prioritise HUMINT. These organisations'' approach to HUMINT relies on deep context, which is a comprehensive understanding of cultural, political, and economic terrain.</p><p>At the same time, these smaller insurgent and militant organisations have adopted critical aspects of state-based intelligence services, such as compartmentalisation, for CI operations. This fusion of state-based techniques with novel and adaptive approaches to intelligence collection could give these smaller groups an advantage over their enemies, particularly nation-states.</p><p>Flat, human, and contextual </p><p>Other insurgent and militant organisations, such as Al-Shabaab, AQAP, and the Islamic State, lack what Hizbullah has in relative abundance: a willing state backer, funding, secure operational space, and access to relatively advanced technology and weaponry. This lack impedes the growth of these groups on some levels, but deficiencies also spur innovation and require higher levels of resilience. In contrast with Hizbullah, Al-Shabaab, AQAP, and - to a far lesser degree - the Islamic State have built intelligence wings that are organisationally flat and reliant on HUMINT.</p><p></p><p>Snapshot of insurgent intelligence wings. (IHS Markit/Michael Horton)</p><p>All three of these insurgent intelligence wings place a premium on HUMINT, partly because they lack the technological resources to develop SIGINT capabilities. However, even if they could develop greater SIGINT capabilities, HUMINT would remain fundamental to their intelligence operations because all three groups - to varying degrees - recognise the importance of ''deep context'', a comprehensive understanding of the cultural, political, and economic terrain that they inhabit and want to dominate.</p><p>This is an extract from an article that appeared in Jane''s Intelligence Review.

APS add layers to the survivability ''onion'' by extending the distance between the vehicle''s armour and the destruction or degradation of the incoming projectile''s capability. By destroying or degrading the threat projectile at a distance from the vehicle, the vehicle is less likely to be hit, if hit less likely to be penetrated and if penetrated less likely to be immobilised or destroyed.</p><p>APS can provide protection against a range of threat projectiles, including:</p><p>Active Protection System</p><p>An active protection system provides situational awareness and detection of threat projectiles out to its furthest capable range. When such a threat is fired towards the vehicle, this is detected and tracked by the APS, which can deploy a soft-kill obscurant such as multispectral smoke, to interfere with the projectile''s targeting and guidance mechanisms. Alternatively, the soft-kill APS may use laser dazzlers or other electro-optical interference systems.</p><p>If only a hard-kill APS is fitted, or if the projectile is not neutralised by a hybrid APS'' soft-kill system, the threat projectile is targeted by either a deployed or distributed hard-kill countermeasure. The former is launched from the vehicle and then uses explosive force and/or fragmentation to destroy the projectile, while the later uses an explosive/fragmentation effect fired directly from the vehicle itself.</p><p></p><p>Western developments</p><p>Germany has a history of developing a number of defensive aids systems, including obscurants, acoustic hostile fire location sensors, laser warning systems, and other components that can subsequently be integrated with soft-kill APSs. The country has developed a number of soft- and hard-kill APSs and is the first Western country to fit a soft-kill APS as standard on its new-build fleet of Puma infantry fighting vehicles (IFVs). This is the Multifunction Self-protection System (MUSS), manufactured by Hensoldt. This soft-kill system was selected to equip the Puma over hard-kill systems.</p><p>Eastern developments</p><p>Russia was the first nation to develop and field an APS - the Drozd system that was employed on a number of T-55AD MBTs from 1983, as well as on some T-80U-M1 MBTs. Drozd is a hard-kill system that relied on unguided 105 mm fragmentation interceptors. Subsequently the Drozd-2 was developed, with this still being marketed but never having entered production for the Russian Army.</p><p>A successor, the Arena APS, and its related export version known as Arena-E, was developed in the early 1990s. Using different hard-kill EFP plates, the Arena system is not believed to have entered service with Russian forces, but is understood to have seen some degree of technology transfer or integration work onto the South Korean K2 MBT.</p><p>Future research and development trajectories</p><p>Cross-domain sensors</p><p>There are a plethora of sensors that have already been developed for use on aircraft that could be transferred to the land domain for use by APSs. These include missile approach and laser warning receivers that could be adapted for use as the sensory component of an APS. As such, if these components can be transferred rather than developed outright, this is likely to generate cost, schedule, and technical benefits.</p><p>Architecture</p><p>While open systems architecture offers a number of advantages for the end-user, including the avoidance of technical and commercial ''lock-in'' to a single or small number of manufacturers and the ability to integrate a variety of different components, the border between intellectual property rights and an open architecture is unclear.</p><p>There are commercial implications required to implement an open systems architecture (OSA) approach to fielding an APS.

They are also capable of fusing of off-board sensor data, enabled by enhanced communication suites and datalinking, together with improved on-board data processing. These developments are clearly illustrated by the employment over time of the NATO and Royal Air Force E-3 Sentry fleets. The NATO E-3A fleet adopted a command and control function after the 1991 Gulf War when its role expanded from air defence to include ground strike management. The RAF''s E-3D was originally a pure Airborne Early Warning asset, but from its time operating over the Balkans in the 1990s it took on a command and control function.

Side-channel analysis is a powerful cryptanalytic technique that aims to extract secret information from the physical emanations of an otherwise secure device.</p><p>This is an extract from an article that appeared in Jane''s Intelligence Review.</p><p>Key Points</p><p>A secret report drafted by the US National Security Agency (NSA) in mid-1972, and approved for public release in September 2007, describes a technical phenomenon related to a piece of military hardware called the 131-B2 encryption device. This device, produced by Bell Telephone Laboratories, was used by the US Army and Navy during the Second World War as part of the US military''s secure teletypewriter communications infrastructure. The underlying encryption scheme used by the 131-B2 devices, called the one-time pad, is in theory completely unbreakable. In fact, this encryption scheme is still used to protect highly sensitive data.</p><p>During testing on a 131-B2 device at Bell Labs, a researcher noticed that each letter processed by the device caused it to emit a high-powered electromagnetic pulse, probably related to the relays operating the paper-punching mechanism used by the teletypewriter. By using an antenna and amplifier, these pulses could then be picked up and decoded almost 80 feet away.</p><p>The method used by the Bell Labs researchers to recover the secrets of the theoretically unbreakable 131-B2 device is called a side-channel attack. Side-channel analysis is a powerful cryptanalytic technique that enables attackers to extract secret information hidden inside many types of devices. Side-channel analysis works by analysing the physical signals, such as power consumption or heat dissipation, that a device emits as it performs a secure computation. First discussed in an academic context by Paul Kocher in 1996, side-channel analysis has been shown to be effective in compromising a plethora of real-world systems, ranging from car immobilisers to video game consoles, and from mass transit cards to high-security cryptographic co-processors.</p><p></p><p>Attack elements</p><p>A successful side-channel attack requires three elements: a source, a modulator, and a receiver. First, a source of secret information, which is typically a sensitive sub-component of the device under test, emits a secret payload during the process of its operation. This secret is then processed by a side-channel modulator, an integral component (such as a system fan) that causes the secret payload to manifest in the physical emanations of the system, such as the system''s power consumption or heat dissipation. This function of the modulator is a by-product of its operation, and was not purposely intended by the system''s designers. Instead, its existence is an artefact of the physical characteristics of the device under test. Finally, the physical emanation is captured by the attacker using a side-channel receiver. The attacker analyses the received emanations and attempts to recover from them as much information about the secret as possible.</p><p>Low-cost side-channel attacks</p><p>Side-channel attacks can be deployed through a low-cost malicious aftermarket peripheral. As illustrated in the graphic ''Low-cost side-channel attack based on a malicious peripheral'', end users often connect unverified aftermarket accessories (1) such as batteries, earphones, or chargers, to their secure mobile devices. While this accessory is connected, the user interacts with a sensitive app on his device (2) such as a payment application. The malicious accessory carries out a power-based side-channel attack on the victim''s phone (3) to recover this secret information. To disclose this information back to the attacker, the malicious device can include an embedded transponder (4) or somehow modulate the compromised information back into the smart device''s regular communications (5), potentially by using a co-operating application on the device. This setting enables the attacker to place a very low-cost embedded set-up with limited measurement, storage, and processing capabilities in close proximity to the device.</p><p></p><p>The content from this blog post is compiled from Jane''s Intelligence Review.

While China seems to be expanding its naval areas of operations in the region, efforts by other countries have focused on mitigating the possibility of reduced access as a consequence of Chinese presence.</p><p>Air Power - The Next Step in the South China Sea''s Strategic Evolution</p><p>Air power will become increasingly crucial within the South China Sea''s maritime environment as China''s growing naval presence in the region will increasingly be backed by air power. China, Indonesia, Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam are building or upgrading runways on islands in the region. China''s facilities in the Spratlys now mean that they have airbases more than 700 miles south of the Chinese mainland. With vast expanses of the South China Sea requiring the use of air assets to maintain effective situational awareness, there are clear signs that air power is going to be an increasingly important aspect moving forward.</p><p>Possible future scenarios for the South China Sea Disputes</p><p>US position</p><p>The United States has stressed the need for diplomatic efforts to resolve disputes, which means that Washington does not see military action as a first choice. In the view of Jane''s analysts, the United States is likely to rally diplomatic support from South East Asian nations and build a broader coalition to counter China''s ambitions in the area. Nonetheless the United States is determined to defend its strategic interests and freedom of navigation in the area.</p><p>Chinese position</p><p>China is likely to continue oppose US intervention in South China Sea disputes, arguing that it wants to resolve disputes through negotiation with the parties directly concerned.

Codenamed Zapad ("West" in Russian), the drill will test how the Russian military and other power and security ministries would respond to an armed attack against Russia, and its ally Belarus, coming from the West.</p><p>Key points:</p><p>What is Zapad?</p><p>Historically, Zapad prepared Soviet, Russian and other allied forces for defensive and offensive operations against NATO countries in high-tempo conventional conflict scenarios. The 1999 iteration of Zapad, the first since the dissolution of the Soviet Union, was held in a direct response to NATO actions over Serbia and Kosovo. Since 2009, the drill has been held regularly at four-year intervals, with the 2013 exercise reportedly simulating a nuclear attack on Warsaw (1).</p><p>Although official press releases often refer to opposing forces as "illegal bands" or "illegal armed groups", it is clear that joint Russian and Belarusian armed forces train operations against a sophisticated, well-equipped conventional force. The only threat Moscow currently faces in the western strategic direction is NATO. However, it should be remembered that whereas Zapad focuses on NATO, another strategic exercise, Vostok, seeks to trains response to armed threats stemming from China, and to a lesser degree Japan.</p><p>Numbers of troops</p><p>Official figures released by the Russian MoD state that the total number of troops involved in Zapad 2017 will stand at 12,700 - most of them being Belarusian Armed Forces personnel (2) Although the true numbers are likely to be higher, any current attempts to estimate the scale of Russian deployments are prone to errors. That said, strategic exercises not only include armed forces units, but also personnel from the Federal Security Service, the Russian National Guard (Rosgvardia), and the Ministry of the Russian Federation for Affairs for Civil Defence, Emergencies and Elimination of Consequences of Natural Disasters. Therefore with all these structures involved in the exercise, the scale could reach 80,000-100,000 troops spread across Western parts of Russia.</p><p>In contrast, the entire armed forces of the Baltic States comprise approximately 21,000 personnel, with Poland adding another 105,000. NATO troops in those countries stand at around 4,500 servicemen although their presence is largely a political message rather than military.</p><p>The threat of war</p><p>The political context of the upcoming iteration of Zapad is different compared to previous drills. It is the first strategic exercise in Russia''s Western axis since the conflict in Ukraine broke out in 2014 and since NATO deployed its troops to Central and Eastern Europe. Consequently, some are concerned that that the Zapad is largely a Russian attempt to increase readiness and conceal deployment of Russian conventional and unconventional units to the border with the Baltic States, Belarus, and Ukraine. From there they could potentially launch surprise armed attacks against those countries.</p><p>Exercise not expected to lead to escalation </p><p>Although Russia''s modus operandi is that exercises can precede invasions, the current international context makes such an attack unlikely.</p><p>When looking at the history of the Soviet Union or Russia, it can be concluded that the political-military leadership deployed combat troops during times of acute political and/or military crisis when Moscow''s interests were threatened. This was the case in Hungary ''56, Czechoslovakia ''68, Afghanistan ''79, Georgia ''08, and finally Ukraine ''14.</p><p>At the moment there is no crisis in Eastern Europe and little suggests such a crisis will materialize during Zapad. Additionally, any such crisis and subsequent decision to deploy troops would need to meet strict military doctrinal criteria before any action was taken for offensive action under Russia''s military doctrine. Presently, such criteria have not been met.</p><p>Jane''s assesses that Russia will try to exhaust all reasonable options, other than military, to achieve its political objectives. Moscow will commit militarily only if its political goals are no longer attainable. In Ukraine in 2014, Russia lost political control over the events unfolding in Kiev and was forced to act militarily to protect its interests in the country.</p><p>If a choice were to be made between achieving strategic surprise and generating appropriate forces to achieve military and political objectives, Moscow would always try to choose the latter. As a result, deployment of troops into the Baltic States would still be seen as a limited objective because it would give NATO time and space to amass and counteract Russian military moves.</p><p>Russia presently does not have enough capability (political, military, and economic) and manpower to wage war against NATO. Neither does it have a reason to attack neighbouring countries. Looking at current state of affairs, there is no crisis in Europe to justify Russian deployment of combat troops to the Baltic States.</p><p>Jane''s delivers open source data and independent expert analysis on political stability, military capabilities, national security concerns, and international relations which provide a strategic, operational and tactical understanding of the global threat landscape.

Jane''s Intelligence Reviewexamines the best practice for conducting this research and providing assessments for decision-makers.</p><p>This is an extract from an article that appeared in Jane''s Intelligence Review.</p><p>Key points:</p><p>Analysts at private organisations and public agencies are increasingly tasked with researching cyber threats. As the range of missions that include cyber threats has broadened, so has the range of potential sources considered useful for collecting intelligence.</p><p>For example, affiliates of terrorist groups such as Al-Qaeda and the Islamic State have run virtual recruitment campaigns and distributed media such as training videos across social networks such as Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube. An analyst tasked with covering threats from transnational terrorist groups such as these would therefore increasingly be required to research the online activity of these groups.</p><p>Similarly, military analysts are now considering the same open-source social media platforms used by terrorists for the distribution of material and recruitment as sources of targeting intelligence. Speaking in 2015, retired United States Air Force General Herbert Carlisle, then head of Air Combat Command, described how "... a post on social media [led] to bombs on target in less than 24 hours". For analysts looking at cyber threats, examples such as this serve to underline the importance of verifying sources and clearly delineating the levels of confidence around their assessments.</p><p></p><p>In a 2012 analysis of the cyber-intelligence practices of 30 organisations, including six from government and 24 from private industry, researchers from the Software Engineering Institute (SEI) at Carnegie Mellon University noted the growing importance of verifying intelligence, writing that, "... the operational tempo required for intelligence analysts to keep pace with the ever-changing cyber environment is overwhelming at best. While technology and external resources offer value, analysts also need to critically assess the information they receive."</p><p>Echoing this sentiment at the Black Hat hacker conference in 2017, Daniel Cuthbert, who has trained public sector and corporate analysts in cyber-intelligence collection for more than a decade with the UK-based hacking consultancy Sensepost, said that the greatest issue facing analysts looking at cyber threats is "establishing truth in the data".</p><p>This raises the question of best practice for cyber-threat analysis, particularly as the range of analyst tasks with a cyber component has broadened, potentially leading to less experienced individuals conducting research on these threats.</p><p>The content from this blog post is compiled from Jane''s Intelligence Review.

This article considers the factors that are influencing how the map of the Middle East might look in five years if current pressures on borders persist.</p><p>The area covering the states of Iraq and Syria was characterised by repressive stability for an extended period from the early 1970s to the first years of the 21st century, with both countries ruled by powerful police-state regimes whose official ideology was the secular Arab nationalism of the Baath Party. The major changes that decisively ended this period of stability were the destruction of late Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein''s regime in 2003 by the US and its allies, and the outbreak of armed insurgency against the government of Syrian president Bashar al-Assad in 2011.</p><p>In Syria, the subsequent Assad government redeployment of June-July 2012 led to the de facto division of Syria into three areas of control: the government-controlled west; Sunni Arab rebel enclaves in the northwest, southwest, and east; and three non-contiguous Kurdish cantons along the Syrian-Turkish border at Afrin, Jazeera, and Kobanê. The rebel area was further subdivided following the entry of the Islamic State in Iraq - rebranded the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant in 2013 - and its expulsion of other rebel groups from its area of control in eastern Syria. Territorial lines of control have altered considerably since mid-2013, but these four entities - the Syrian government, Kurds, Sunni Arab rebels, and the fast-eroding Islamic State - remain in existence.</p><p>The Islamic State''s advance into Iraq in mid-2014 led to a similar de facto division. The swift conquest by the Sunni jihadists of a large area of central Iraq, the jihad fatwa of Ayatollah Ali Sistani in June 2014, the subsequent mobilisation of Shia militia forces, and the important role played by Kurdish fighters of the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) and Partiya Karkerên Kurdistan (PKK) have also produced a de facto reality of three entities in Iraq: the Baghdad government, the KRG, and the Islamic State.</p><p>By August 2017, the area under the control of the Islamic State since 2014 - straddling the Iraqi-Syrian border - was in an advanced state of erosion, but other components of the regional fragmentation looked set to survive. With the war against the Islamic State in Iraq nearing completion, and a process of de-escalation under way that will divide Syria into various areas of control, the future will depend on the evolution of the various entities that now comprise these fragmented areas, specifically the Syrian government-controlled area, the Syrian Kurdish cantons, the Sunni Arab rebel-controlled areas in north-western and southern Syria, the Turkish-controlled enclave between Azaz and Jarabulus, the Islamic State area in Iraq and Syria, the Kurdish Regional Government in northern Iraq, the Iraqi government-controlled area, and the predominantly Sunni Arab areas of Iraq.</p><p>The wars in Iraq and Syria are not closed systems, but involve the active engagement of regional and global powers.

For more information or to subscribe visit Jane''s Intelligence Review.</p><p>The Arctic has been gradually warming since the middle of the 19th century, and since 1950 this trend has accelerated. It has heated up twice as rapidly as the rest of the planet, and average temperatures are now higher than at any time in at least the last 2,000 years - and probably much longer - according to a 2012 report by the Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme (AMAP), a working group of intergovernmental organisation the Arctic Council. The most visible and immediate consequence of this warming is a decline in sea ice, especially in the summer, raising hopes for increasingly easy access to resources and shipping routes in the region, but also raising geopolitical concerns.</p><p></p><p>Arctic security. (Esri, DigitalGlobe, GeoEye, Earthstar Geographics, CNES/Airbus DS, USDA, USGS, AeroGRID, IGN and the GIS User Community/IHS Markit/Mauricio Beltran)</p><p>Vanishing ice</p><p>The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reported in 2013 that the area of the Arctic Ocean with year-round ice cover fell by 11.5% per decade between 1979 and 2012. According to the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration, this rate is accelerating, and is now 13.3%. The maximum ice extent in winter has decreased more slowly - between 3.5% and 4.1% per decade - but April 2017 was a seasonal record low. Moreover, the 2016 summer minimum ice extent was the second-lowest on record. The melt season has also been lengthening: the duration of ice-free conditions in the region between the East Siberian Sea and the western Beaufort Sea, for example, increased by nearly three months between 1979 and 2012.</p><p></p><p>Decline in Arctic sea ice volume, 1979 - 2017 (IHS Markit)</p><p>High stakes</p><p>There are three potential shipping routes connecting the Bering Strait and the North Atlantic through the Arctic: the Northwest Passage (NWP) through the Canadian archipelago; the Northeast Passage (NEP) along the Russian coast, which includes the Northern Sea Route (NSR), an administrative entity comprising seaways under Russian jurisdiction between Novaya Zemlya archipelago and the Bering Strait, but excluding the Barents, Pechora, and White seas; and a direct Transpolar Passage (TPP). None of these routes comprises discrete sea lanes, but rather broad and, in places, overlapping corridors consisting of multiple alternative channels whose navigability depends on varying ice conditions.</p><p>At present, the TPP is only navigable during the year by heavy icebreakers or submarines, and the other routes are only open inconsistently during the summer. Scott Stephenson and Professor Laurence Smith of the University of California, Los Angeles, reported in March 2013 that the probability of a technically feasible transit of the NSR by non-ice-strengthened vessels in any given year rose from 40% in 1979-2005 to 61% in 2006-15, and will reach 98% by 2040-59 under high-emissions scenarios.</p><p>The probability of such a transit of the NWP will increase from less than 15% currently to 50% by 2050. Choosing whether to ship through the passage in summer, according to Smith, "will become a coin toss", but "this will never be a year-round operation". Along the TPP, the ice will be sufficiently thin in summer for "moderately capable icebreakers [Polar Class 6] to go where they please", said Smith.</p><p>These routes potentially all offer significant savings in time, distance, and cost for shipping operating between Asian and European or North American ports. Various economic studies - none of which is judged by Jane''s to be entirely comprehensive or authoritative - collectively suggest that fuel prices, insurance, icebreaker fees, and construction costs for ice-capable ships are critical variables in determining whether such savings can be achieved.</p><p></p><p>Competition risks</p><p>Five issues - resource competition, underwater conflict, the Greenland-Iceland-UK (GIUK) gap, SLOCs, and a spillover crisis - may drive increased strategic competition in the Arctic. The likelihood of such competition escalating into crisis and conflict remains low, but the consequences of any such escalation would be very high, given the nature of the stakeholders in the region and the significance of the issues at stake.</p><p>Globally, countries are using the sea to a greater extent to boost economic strength, both through traditional resources such as oil, gas, and fisheries, and increasingly through other resources such as minerals. Access to resources below the surface, on the sea-bed, and below the seabed will become increasingly critical. In the Arctic, many resources lie within established territorial waters, but competition for them may become increasingly acute for several reasons: more resources will become available as climate change continues; Russia will wish to secure access to Arctic resources; and there may be increasing interest from non-littoral Arctic members, such as China and the European Union.</p><p></p><p>A model of a Russian seismic survey submarine for Arctic operations photographed on 28 March 2017, showing the distinctive wing-like structures. (Oleg Kuleshov)</p><p>In terms of military activity, submarine and anti-submarine operations, including MPA deployments, are a primary focus for both NATO and Russia. To project power and protect territories, submarines are a central element of the Arctic''s strategic balance, and naval competition is already under way beneath the ice; the ability to operate under ice will continue to provide strategic advantage.</p><p>Outlook</p><p>Overall, the risk of conflict in the Arctic remains low, but the consequences of any crisis would be high. The strategic importance of the Arctic will continue to grow, despite the uncertainties surrounding climate change and ice-melt projections. Even without the potential economic benefits and the need to protect them, increasingly ice-free conditions mean that there is also a greater potential for confrontation sparked by issues outside the region.</p><p>Although the declared aspirations of Arctic states are to develop and maintain the North as a zone of peace, stability, and prosperity, the absence of institutionalised governance structures or a regional security architecture will continue to make this a major challenge. Officials from littoral Arctic countries routinely stress that resolving the region''s security issues is not a military matter, but military presence in the region is undoubtedly prominent and growing.</p><p>Arctic stakeholders - increasingly focused on regional security issues - appear to be concerned about the military and security balance, and the twin policy drivers of de-escalation and avoiding a military build-up are likely to hold in the immediate future. However, in the medium term, serious concerns will remain in the West about the direction of Russia''s Arctic military development - particularly if Russia sees an opportunity in NATO''s focus elsewhere to put down markers relating to its interests.</p><p>The content from this blog post is compiled from Jane''s Intelligence Review.

Operational and strategic planners must integrate and empower novel alternative analysis methods and mind-sets that challenge existing assumptions, expand analytical filters and enable more flexible planning efforts to meet the challenges and opportunities of the future.</p><p>An Expanding Focus</p><p>A survey of unclassified defence white papers reveals a long list of technologies of broad interest to defence communities around the world. Indeed, the Jane''s Strategic Assessments and Futures Studies Centre tracks over two dozen categories of emerging technologies in which modern militaries are making material investments.</p><p>Some of the these technologies - artificial intelligence, big data analytics, additive manufacturing, advanced and smart materials, virtual and augmented reality, unmanned systems, remote sensing - are central to most modern militaries'' efforts to enable new effects and enhance the effectiveness of people, platforms and systems on the future battlefield.</p><p>Others are more niche, specialized or high-end, such as hypersonic and electro-magnetic weapons, quantum computing and directed energy. Fewer states may be investing in the highest-end applications of these technologies, but the capabilities these technologies enable are potentially highly-destabilizing to military and geopolitical competitions.</p><p>Ultimately, disparate development of disruptive technologies, both individually and collectively, portends radical shifts in the nature, properties and applications of future military capabilities. However, the future of technology and capability development is unlikely to unfold along a straight, or, more importantly, single, line. Different actors will prioritize development of different technologies to be used in different ways to achieve potentially similar effects.</p><p>Multi-Dimensional Innovation</p><p>Militarily-relevant technologies are no longer being produced solely by the global defence industry, but are increasingly being developed by commercial firms, research institutes and academia, further contributing to the expanding focus of innovation in defence technologies.</p><p>Multi-dimensional innovation is already reshaping what constitutes the global defence industry and producing deepening implications for defence communities, the industries that support them and how they engage with one another.</p><p>For example, the Israeli Defence Force''s (IDF) Unit 8200 has served as a powerful incubator for spin-off Israeli high-tech start-ups that go on to expand their efforts beyond support to the IDF to commercial markets and the more diverse funding streams that accompany these markets. The US Department of Defense''s DIU(X) program is designed to achieve the opposite result: leveraging the high-tech expertise resident in America''s commercial technology hubs to better service defence programs.</p><p>Interaction with non-defence industry enterprises is seen as ever more vital, but also tricky. Reforming procurement and engagement models does not happen overnight, and most high-tech companies lack the institutional patience required to navigate Ministry and Department of Defence processes. Moreover, traditional defence industry players chafe at the suggestion that meaningful innovation in new technologies only takes place outside the defence industry, further intensifying the drive for competitive discriminators in an already savagely competitive market.</p><p>Technology Diffusion</p><p>Commercial development of relevant technologies is just one of the growing pathways of military and dual use technology proliferation, a dynamic that is further diffusing the power to disrupt.</p><p>Many states are engaged in expansive and aggressive efforts to acquire advanced technologies and expertise through both licit and illicit means in order to stimulate innovation and help mature their defence industry. China''s defence industrial base has made impressive strides in many militarily-relevant technology areas despite seemingly strong structural constraints against ground-breaking innovation. Rapid development of unmanned systems, quantum computing, additive manufacturing and ballistic missile technologies, among others, have all benefitted from aggressive efforts to acquire dual-use Western technology, including through sharing of technologies between commercial and military arms of state-owned enterprises.</p><p>Non-state actors have also benefitted from new means of commercial and dual use technology diffusion. Notably, there is an impressive history of Islamist extremist groups and insurgents in Iraq, Syria, and across the Middle East leveraging commercially available technologies (including software, encryption technologies, electromagnetic jammers, and drones) to present new threats, exploit vulnerabilities and counteract rival capabilities.</p><p></p><p>Above: a still from a video showing two Islamic State militants launching a Skywalker X7/8 UAV carrying two IEDs over the Tigris river.</p><p>Operational Concepts and Novel Applications </p><p>Currently, most attention is paid to the ''what'' of technological innovation. However, the pace and scale of the diffusion of emerging technologies also places a premium on understanding the ''how'' of technology and capability use - that is, the operational concepts state and non-state actors employ and the proclivities, mind-sets, objectives, and priorities that shape these concepts.</p><p>Think of the improvised explosive device, a low tech weapon, to be sure, but deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan in unanticipated ways - contrary to the conventions of modern warfare - to massive disruptive effect. The need to understand not only what adversaries and competitors have, but also how they might use it on the battlefield requires innovation in methods that help defence communities better understand and think like their adversaries and, as a result, better deter, dissuade, diminish, degrade or defeat uncertain and dynamic future threats.</p><p>Alternative Futures Analysis</p><p>Identifying the origin, nature, pace and trajectory of future threats in this environment constitutes a daunting intelligence challenge.</p><p>Improved tradecraft and the latest in machine learning and automation technologies will be necessary, but not sufficient to cope with the ''endemic surprises'' of the future.</p><p>New dimensions of threat are shaping radically new questions for defence communities, which are, in turn, demanding fundamentally new answers, buttressed by unconventional mind-sets and integration of methods that facilitate both.</p><p>Scenario planning, red teaming and wargaming all stand out as especially relevant techniques.

According to Conflict Monitor, since the start of 2017 the Islamic State''s territory has quickly reduced by 40%, while its revenues have dropped by 80%. At current rates of territorial loss, the group will have only residual territorial influence from late 2017 onwards and is unlikely to remain in control of areas before its fourth year comes to a close in June 2018.</p><p>However, the loss of territory will not mark the end of the Islamic State as a militant organisation. In all likelihood, the group will transition from a pseudo-state to an underground armed insurgency and remain able to conduct asymmetric attacks against security forces in both Iraq and Syria, continuing to undermine security and central governance. Additionally, it will seek to maintain some semblance of its former governance structure as a shadow state, carrying out summary justice through abductions and executions and portraying itself as exercising power in areas under government control.</p><p></p><p>International element</p><p>Since the establishment of the Islamic State on 29 June 2014, the group has actively called for retaliatory attacks against Western civilian and military personnel in their home countries.</p><p>Jane''s Terrorism and Insurgency Centre (JTIC) has recorded 32 attacks attributed to the Islamic State across 11 countries in Europe between 13 November 2015 and 18 August 2017, killing a total of at least 323 people and wounding at least 794. This has included attacks conducted by small cells or lone actors with varying, usually minimal, levels of connection to and support from the group.</p><p>Sectarian tensions across Iraq, and to an extent in Syria, will enable the group to continue waging an armed campaign and undermine security in its heartlands, but the group will also continue to focus on planning, facilitating, and encouraging attacks internationally to maintain its relevance and influence globally. This will also be hoped to inspire more lone actors, who''s small-scale but frequent attacks will help keep the notion of the Islamic State alive and active. The international element''s importance for the Islamic State will increase as its focus in Iraq and Syria shifts back towards insurgency in the wake of large-scale territorial losses.</p><p>Reverberations in Europe: foreign fighters and other returnees will transform the terrorism threat</p><p>The conflicts in Iraq and Syria and the rise of the Islamic State have defined a generation of militant Islamists in the region and abroad. Across Europe, they have motivated around 5,000 men to travel to participate in the conflict and become foreign fighters, while in many cases spouses and underage children have also immigrated to the group''s territories alongside the men. Many children have also been born in Iraq and Syria within the Islamic State''s territory to foreign fighters.</p><p>The potential return of these communities en masse from the conflict zones presents the most significant driver of Islamist terrorism in Europe in both the short and long term. Returning combat-experienced militants will pose an immediate security threat in the short term, while the wider communities associated with those fighters will present long-term challenges for the radicalisation of a new generation of militant Islamists.</p><p>De-radicalisation efforts must focus across the family unit</p><p>While counter-terrorism efforts must primarily focus on foreign fighters most likely to conduct attacks, any de-radicalisation programmes implemented by European countries to specifically deal with returnees should ensure that the wives and children of foreign fighters are actively included within their remit. In its Rumiyah magazine, published monthly since September 2016, an increasing number of features have focused on women''s roles in the Islamic State''s battle; on supporting their husbands'' work as militants; on tending to and "reforming" her children and encouraging them to engage in combat and aspire to martyrdom; and even on participating in combat when it was required. A failure to include this segment of society in a plan to mitigate Islamist militancy in Europe would be to allow an indoctrinated core segment of Islamist communities to continue facilitating the radicalisation of a new generation of potential militant Islamists. At present, most countries will lack an effective program for dealing with returning foreign fighters, and legislation across European countries differs as to whether travelling to Syria or Iraq to join a group gives grounds for arrest or not.</p><p></p><p>Power vacuum may lead to resurgence of Al-Qaeda</p><p>The Islamic State''s decline will have significant impacts on how the terrorism threat develops both in the group''s heartlands in Iraq and Syria and around the world. For global militant Islamism, the group''s campaign in Iraq and Syria has created a legacy that will continue to inspire militancy for years to come. In Europe, returning foreign fighters and their families will present one of the key drivers of the developing terrorism threat in the five- to ten-year outlook, with these individuals crystallising the Islamic State''s legacy for local Islamist communities and militant networks in Europe. More widely, the Islamic State''s decline will likely open up a vacuum, in which the role of Al-Qaeda will increase markedly; how the relationship between Al-Qaeda and the Islamic State develops will have direct implications for international terrorism, and will be a key indicator of the form attacks in the West will take in the future.</p><p>The content from this blog post is compiled from Jane''s Terrorism and Insurgency Centre.

Facing heavy attacks in Raqqa and Tal Afar and with rapidly shrinking revenues and territory, Islamic State''s decline appears to be almost irreversible.</p><p></p><p>In the wake of depleting numbers of male militants, the group has begun to adjust its narrative to appeal to an untapped resource - female fighters.</p><p>Despite Islamic State''s claims to the contrary, urging women to seek an active role in combat is most likely an attempt to reduce the impact of severe manpower shortages caused by the decimation of male fighters, and a recruitment crisis. While Islamic State has used female suicide bombers in the past, it has not done so in the concentration seen in Mosul, where current estimates of female-led suicide bombings stand at more than 40. It is as yet unclear whether the spike in female suicide bombings is simply a result of the final pockets of Islamic State resistance or women compelled by the group to execute those attacks, or whether it represents the beginning of a wider trend of female fighters willing to take part in the group''s battles.</p><p>Foreign fighters'' wives and widows targeted  </p><p>Islamic State''s online magazine Rumiyah indicates a revisal of previous messaging surrounding the role of women. In an article entitled ''Our Journey to Allah'', the author (likely a woman) emphasizes that the role of women is of increased importance, as "ahead of us await times of intense trials and extreme hardships, and times of severe battles" (Issue 11, released July 13).</p><p>Rumiyah magazine is released in several western languages, including French, German and English, indicating that this call is primarily directed at a Western audience, likely the wives and widows of foreign fighters still living in the group''s self-proclaimed Caliphate.</p><p>This rhetoric marks a stark contrast to previous propaganda that had highlighted women''s primary function as wives and mothers of mujahidin.

Ballistic missile production is forecast to be worth 30 percent of this market, while missile defense will account for 16 percent.</p><p>According to Jane''s Markets Forecast, the 10-year missile market in China is forecast to have a value of USD37.7 billion with 44 percent of it, or USD16.6 billion, dedicated to the development and procurement of new ballistic missiles. China is currently undergoing a significant modernization effort with the People''s Liberation Army (PLA) Rocket Force replacing older liquid-fueled missiles, such as the DF-5, with missiles with solid fuel propellant, such as the DF-41. However, there is also greater potential for medium and intermediate range ballistic missiles to be used as tactical rather than strategic weapons. In addition to forming part of China''s nuclear deterrent, the PLA Rocket Force''s missiles can be armed with a variety of conventional warheads in order to be used as long-range artillery.</p><p>Perhaps the most significant role for China''s ballistic missiles is as part of its wider anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) strategy, with variants of the DF-21 MRBM and DF-26 IRBM developed as anti-ship ballistic missiles. This strategy, intended to maintain influence in the Western Pacific in competition with the United States, is a major driver of Chinese missile procurement.</p><p>As well as ballistic missiles, China is looking to pursue an A2/AD strategy through the deployment of new air and missile defense capabilities, such as the procurement of S-400 batteries from Russia. Such a move is intended to deter incursions into Chinese territory by both aircraft and potential long-range strike weapons.</p><p>Ballistic missile developments in North Korea also act as a key missile procurement driver for Japan and South Korea, with both countries looking to strengthen their missile defenses. In Japan, the introduction of the SM-3 Block IIA missile is expected to account for the majority of the Japanese missile market, with approximately 36 interceptors. The Japanese missile market is forecast to amount to a total of USD2.1 billion for the next 10 years.</p><p>South Korea is currently in the process of augmenting its patriot batteries with the locally developed Cheongung air and missile defense system. The Cheongung system will replace South Korea''s HAWK batteries and has been specifically designed to intercept short-range ballistic missiles. While South Korea is currently receiving support from the United States for missile defense, in the form of Patriot PAC-3 and THAAD batteries deployed on the peninsular, the future is likely to see a move towards a greater use of locally developed systems. This can be seen through the deployment of the Cheongung system and also in South Korea''s efforts to develop an exo-atmospheric interception capability for Cheongung, Cheolmae 4-H. This would provide a capability similar to THAAD. South Korea is expected to spend USD10.8 billion on missiles for the next 10 years.</p><p>For Taiwan, as with South Korea, there is a focus on air defense with the introduction of the locally produced Tien Kung 3 air defense system to replace HAWK. Taiwan is also receiving Patriot PAC-3 interceptors from the United States in a further effort to bolster its missile defenses. However, given the large scale of the PLA''s missile inventory in South East China, it is questionable how effective such defenses could be.</p><p>The content from this blog post is compiled from Jane''s industry solutions.

If this rhetoric continues, both sides may find themselves trapped into conducting a military response that could be devastating for the region. For North Korea, the threat against Guam is very specific and sets a bar to be measured against. Not following through could be seen as a lack of resolve.</p><p>The ability to hit the US mainland is part of Pyongyang''s efforts to ensure the US and its allies do not embark on a programme of regime change. Despite the apparent success of its ICBM programme and ability to mount nuclear weapons onto its missiles, there is still debate over whether the North''s re-entry vehicles (RVs) are capable of surviving re-entry, as the 28 July Hwasong-14 (KN-20) test appears to have disintegrated upon re-entering the atmosphere. Nevertheless, there could be a number of reasons for the debris seen in the footage, including the burn up of second stage, or that the additional pressures on the RV created by the lofted trajectory caused a breakup, but the RV may still be viable for a normal trajectory.</p><p>In May 2016, after analysing the video of the KN-08 and mock-up of the nuclear warhead, Jane''s by IHS Markit assessed, with reasonable confidence, that the RV for that missile was viable and would survive re-entry. Even if the North is experiencing difficulties with its RVs, it appears that it will only be a matter of time before they achieve this and can hit the US.</p><p>This closing window itself may be a source of pressure on Trump, who may feel compelled to act before this is demonstrated. Unilateral US action, however, could have serious implications for Seoul and Tokyo.</p><p>From the North Korean perspective all sanctions are part of a programme of isolation and regime change. They argue that talks on nuclear disarmament need to be seen in a global context, and not about their programme in particular. The US insistence on a stopping of nuclear activity as a pre-condition for talks are seen by some in the US as a way of preventing the reward for ''bad behaviour'', but this position is counter-productive and ignores the North''s perspective that this is a pillar of its survival. There are also practical complications in verifying that the North has stopped its nuclear and missile activities.

(Arda Mevlutoglu)</p><p>“Peshrev” in traditional Turkish wrestling is the warming period before the game, where the opponents make shows to boost morale of supporters while intimidating and deterring the rival. It also means the introductory piece played before the main song in Turkish classical music.</p><p>This year between 27 March and 7 April, the Turkish Navy (Turk Deniz Kuvvetleri) conducted a large-scale exercise, “Deniz Yildizi” (Starfish, or literally Sea Star). The 2017 version of the exercise saw significantly high numbers of warships, submarines and auxiliaries from the Turkish Navy, as well as port visits to Bulgaria (Varna), Romania (Constanta), Ukraine (Odessa), Russia (Novorossiysk) and Georgia (Batumi). In total, 10 frigates, three corvettes, eight patrol boats, two mine hunters, four submarines and three support ships took part in the exercise.</p><p>Deniz Yildizi in itself can be considered as a show of force after the July 15th coup attempt, but it also delivered a strong message, or reply, to Russia.</p><p>Speaking at the conclusion of military exercises conducted in Southern Military District in September 2016, Chief of General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces, General Valeriy Gerasimov said that the Black Sea Fleet of the Russian Naval Forces “is now stronger than Turkey’s navy” and claimed that Russian Navy had received the capability of easily striking the Turkish Straits. Gerasimov stated that, “Turkey was virtually the master of the Black Sea. Now everything is different”. The tone of his statements was in stark contrast with the ambience of Russian – Turkish relations, which were being restored shortly after the July 15th coup attempt.</p><p>Another noteworthy aspect of his speech was the tribute to the Kalibr cruise missiles, which form the backbone of Russia’s A2/AD (Anti Access Area Denial) strategy in the Black Sea basin, together with S-300 / S-400 air defence systems and Bastion coastal anti-ship missile batteries. The “Calibration” of the Russian Navy is especially evident in the Black Sea Fleet, with the new Project 636.6 Varshavyanka class submarines, Project 11356 Admiral Grigorovich class frigates and Project 21631 Buyan M class corvettes, though the two ships of the latter class are reportedly transferred to its Baltic Fleet in November last year. It is noteworthy that the Black Sea Fleet undertakes a significant role in Russian operations in Syria, through cruise missile strikes and the famous “Syrian Express” logistic support campaign.</p><p>The modernisation of the Black Sea Fleet gained momentum after the 2008 Russo – Georgian War. Significant amount of resources was diverted to shipbuilding programs for this unit, including the construction of six Varshavyanka class diesel electric submarines capable of firing Kalibr missiles, six Admiral Grigorovich class frigates and Project 21631 Buyan-M class corvettes.</p><p>Russia also is in the process of modernising its air assets in the region: After the annexation of Crimea, Sukhoi Su-27 and Su-30SM fighter aircraft as well as Tupolev Tu-22M3 strategic bombers were deployed to the peninsula. In several occasions, Russian Su-24MR and Su-27 jets came into close proximity of U.S. aircraft and warships present in the region, followed by the protest of the latter.</p><p>Turkey, on the other hand, has undertaken an ambitious modernisation process through the development of local defence industry since early 2000’s. One of the most important projects of this campaign is the MilGem (Milli Gemi; National Ship) project, which covers indigenous design and construction of corvette class warships. The first two ships of the MilGem program are in service with the Turkish Navy under Ada class, with two more to be commissioned in 2018 and 2019. Following four ships of the MilGem program are designated “I” class with improved weapons and sensors outfit, including anti air warfare capabilities. Construction of the first ship of the I class, the Istanbul commenced earlier this year. Meanwhile, six air independent propulsion (AIP) submarines of German Type 214TN design are being constructed at Golcuk Naval Shipyard and an indigenous submarine design project under the MilDen program has recently started. Another major program, the TF-2000 area air warfare frigate program is expected to be commenced soon, with the first ship planned to enter service in the first half of 2020’s.</p><p>As a conclusion, it can be claimed that despite warming relations between Russia and Turkey, there is a tense, but silent competition for the dominance over the Black Sea. Russia seems to put special emphasis over the modernisation of the Black Sea Fleet as centre of its A2/AD strategy against NATO. After the breakup of the Soviet Union, Turkey had enjoyed superiority over Russia in the region, especially in the naval domain. This position is now under threat, through naval and missile developments from the Russian side. However, those programs are not immune to challenges. The cut off of supply of major sub systems from Ukraine inflicted serious damage to warship programs. Financial problems are also threatening timely and effective execution of modernisation programs. The restructuring and renovation of the Turkish Armed Forces after July 15th is an important factor in the Turkish side. Given these issues and factors, it can be claimed that the “peshrev” of the two sides over the Black Sea will continue at a constant tempo for the foreseeable future.</p><p>IHS Markit guest blogger Arda Mevlutoglu,Defence Policy Analyst</p><p>Arda Mevlutoglu holds a BSc degree in Astronautical Engineering from Istanbul Technical University and an MSc degree in Science and Technology Policy Studies from Middle East Technical University.

Their objective is to maximise lethality and capability with responsive ISR capabilities supporting near-realtime decision-making. You stand back and you look at Amazon, who really in my view started user analytics, and what they do with data [to drive recommendation algorithms], ... I think what defence has done and military operations in general [are doing] is taking that capability and transferring it into their applications." </p><p>Jane Chappell, vice-president of the Global Intelligence Solutions (GIS) mission area of Raytheon Intelligence, Information, and Services (IIS) agreed. "Quite frankly, there is a lot of that work going on. There is a lot of focus on making sure that defence takes advantage of what is happening in commercial applications and the innovation that is happening there, and making sure that that gets applied towards their mission." </p><p>Although large internet companies, such as Facebook or LinkedIn, have been the pioneers of leveraging open-source data to drive algorithms and software architecture, militaries are looking into open-source data that incorporate many more sources than social media intelligence (SOCMINT).</p><p>Human intervention</p><p>Another challenge is the deficit of personnel that have been trained in managing systems that process enormous amounts of data at a high speed, and the closed-off nature of military analytics tools can make aggregating data across departments difficult. In addition, militaries want to ensure that critical decisions stay in the hands of human decision makers as the machine elements in this complex chain of systems grow and are exponentially faster than the human elements.</p><p>"Sometimes, we are not doing enough because we don''t have enough people, because the processes today are fairly manual," Johnson said. "One way we can do more is to insert more automated analysis into that cycle."</p><p>"It is going to be the integration of machine-to-machine communications, artificial intelligence, and a better machine-to-human connection that''s going to help us maintain our edge," Johnson added. "But it is also going to be dependent on our ability to ''break the stovepipes'' of the systems that we use to enable better integration.

"Everything is a network, and understanding the connections between people and capabilities and ideologies and intent is more important now than it used to be, when things were more static and we understood things. That requires more nuance and more alternative views, and that''s really where machine intelligence can help in helping us put the pieces together in different ways."</p><p>Future clouds</p><p>Chappell also explained that cloud computing, in particular, was an important technology to deal with large volumes of data and enable faster sharing of asymmetric data types for decision makers."You know as you continue to have access to more and more data and need to process that data, it''s important to have the elasticity that comes with the cloud," Chappell said.</p><p>"Cloud computing or virtualising ... can augment [tactical systems]," Johnson agreed. "Cloud is a term that definitely needs some definition because you can have a private cloud or even a tactical cloud where everything is closed and cyber-hardened and deployed in a military network."</p><p>"That is good because it allows those mission-critical applications and systems to more efficiently use the hardware resources.

Most of these involved either the use of chlorine or sulphur mustard agents, delivered with mortars, rockets and IEDs. The Islamic State uses chemical weapons mainly for their psychological impact, as their lethality does not exceed the use of conventional weapons.</p><p>The only alleged use of CW by the Islamic State in Syria this year was on 8 January 2017 at Talla al-Maqri in Aleppo province. For comparison, there were 13 allegations in the previous six months, concentrated in the same area of Aleppo province. All other recorded allegations of the Islamic State using CW in 2017 have been in Iraq; nine inside the besieged city of Mosul, and another single allegation near al-Atheem in Diyala province.</p><p>"The operation to isolate and recapture the Iraqi city of Mosul coincides with a massive reduction in Islamic State chemical weapons use in Syria", said Columb Strack, senior Middle East analyst at IHS Markit. "This suggests that the group has not established any further CW production sites outside Mosul, although it is likely that some specialists were evacuated to Syria and retain the expertise."</p><p>Mosul was at the centre of the Islamic State''s chemical weapons production. IHS Markit assesses that the siege of Mosul, and targeted killings of CW experts in US Coalition airstrikes, have significantly degraded the Islamic State''s already low CW production capability. The continuing CW attacks in Mosul most likely draw on remaining stockpiles in the city.</p><p>Nevertheless, the Islamic State probably retains the capability to produce small batches of low quality chlorine and sulphur mustard agents elsewhere, for example to enhance the psychological impact of suicide car bombings attacks in urban areas or in terrorist attacks abroad.</p><p>About Conflict Monitor</p><p>Conflict Monitor by IHS Markit is an open-source intelligence collection and analysis service.

This marks a 40 percent reduction in territory since the start of 2017, and a 60 percent reduction overall since our first estimate in January 2015, when the jihadist group controlled 90,800 km2 in Iraq and Syria.</p><p></p><p>"The Islamic State''s rise and fall has been characterized by rapid inflation, followed by steady decline,", said Columb Strack, senior Middle East analyst at IHS Markit. "Three years after the ''Caliphate'' was declared, it is evident that the group''s governance project has failed."</p><p></p><p>Pressure on the Islamic State is intense. US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) have advanced into the outskirts of Raqqa, while Syrian government forces are pushing east towards Deir al-Zour, the IHS Markit analysis says. In Iraq, government forces and Iran-backed militias are preparing to eliminate the last remaining pockets of Islamic State control in Hawija, Tal Afar and al-Qaim once the Mosul operation is complete.</p><p>"The Islamic State''s remaining caliphate is likely to break up before the end of the year, reducing its governance project to a string of isolated urban areas that will eventually be retaken over the course of 2018," Strack said.</p><p>Islamic State''s economy collapses</p><p>As the ''Caliphate'' shrinks, the Islamic State''s average monthly revenue has fallen dramatically from $81 million in Q2 2015 to $16 million in Q2 2017, a reduction of 80 percent.</p><p>This includes a steady decline in all of the group''s financial streams: oil production and smuggling, taxation and confiscation, and other illicit activities. Average monthly oil revenue is down 88 percent, and income from taxation and confiscation has fallen by 79 percent, compared to our initial estimate in 2015.</p><p>"Territorial losses are the main factor contributing to the Islamic State''s loss of revenue," said Ludovico Carlino, senior Middle East analyst at IHS Markit. "Losing control of the heavily populated Iraqi city of Mosul, and oil rich areas in the Syrian provinces of Raqqa and Homs, has had a particularly significant impact on the group''s ability to generate revenue."</p><p></p><p>The Islamic State''s ability to increase the fiscal burden on the population it governs, to compensate for financial losses, appears to have reached its limits. The Conflict Monitor team has not identified any significant changes to taxes and fines imposed by the Islamic State since late 2016.</p><p>"Although the Islamic State still appears to be involved in some commercial activity, especially oil production, there are indications that it is attempting to increase its financial ''reserves'', accelerating the shift from a highly bureaucratic and centralized quasi-state economy towards funding a future insurgency through a real war-economy," Carlino said. "An attempt to force people living in the Caliphate to pay all transactions with the Golden Dinar - the group''s currency announced last year - is the most evident indicator of this trend".</p><p>The impact of the drop in revenue on the Islamic State''s ability to fund itself has been offset somewhat by the drastically reduced number of people the group governs. While its revenue decreases, so do its expenses.</p><p>Attacks abroad likely to increase before they decrease</p><p>Military defeat and the loss of territory in Syria and Iraq will be insufficient to sway the views of Islamic State supporters. The group''s video productions have declined in frequency, suggesting that it is less capable of disseminating its messages. However, it has already prepared its followers for the loss of territory.</p><p>Territorial losses are driving the Islamic State to intensify its campaign of terrorist attacks abroad to compensate.</p><p>"Egyptian, Saudi Arabian and UAE efforts at weakening radicals'' influence, and pressuring clerics to develop a new interpretation of Islam that is reconciled with modernity, are likely to drive some Islamist conservatives into embracing violence," said Firas Modad, senior Middle East analyst at IHS Markit.</p><p>"Efforts by Western governments to confront Islamists are likely to have the same effect.

The analysis of the Conflict Monitor dataset of geocoded indicator events for Syria, compares the number of recorded incidents of fighting between Syrian government forces and insurgents for each province in the 17 days before and after the de-escalation plan was signed in Astana on 4 May 2017.</p><p>The data shows a significant reduction in the level of fighting in the four areas designated as de-escalation zones (see infographic below). These include rebel-held areas in and around Idlib, the Talbiseh pocket in Homs, the eastern suburbs of Damascus, and the far south of the country. The 30% increase in recorded fighting in Homs province has been driven by the recent government offensive against the Islamic State around Palmyra, and does not relate to the Talbiseh pocket that forms part of the de-escalation plan.</p><p>In contrast to the reduction in fighting in western Syria, there has been an increase in fighting further east, particularly in Rif Dimashq, eastern Homs, and Deir al-Zour provinces. This suggests that the Astana plan is being used by the Syrian government and its backers, Russia and Iran, to free up government forces in an attempt to secure Deir al-Zour and retake control of the main road crossings into Iraq from the Islamic State, before US-backed forces do.</p><p></p><p>Despite the Astana de-escalation plan, a political settlement to end the war remains very unlikely, given conditions on the ground</p><p>The Syrian government has increased territory under its control by 23% between the start of the Russian military intervention in September 2015 and May 2017 (see map below). It is now also performing better than at any point in the past three and a half years, with record gains made in April and May, according to the latest Conflict Monitor data.</p><p>President Bashar al-Assad has consolidated his hold over core areas in western Syria, controls all the major cities, and his government''s survival is effectively guaranteed by Russia. The opposition, for its part, is fragmented, retaining very few bargaining chips that would give it leverage in future negotiations, and has lost much of its perceived legitimacy, becoming dominated politically by Islamists, and militarily by jihadists affiliated with either Al-Qaeda or the Islamic State.</p><p></p><p>There appears to be an acceptance by the US and its allies that retaining the existing government as part of a future settlement is the ''least bad'' option. In any event, the increased extent of Russian military involvement, including deployment of advanced anti-aircraft missile batteries across the country, effectively excludes the option of US-backed regime change by force.</p><p>There have been several initiatives to find a political settlement to the civil war, by the United Nations in Geneva and Vienna, and more recently by Russia, Iran, and Turkey in Astana. Some incremental progress has been made; however, IHS Markit assesses that a political settlement remains very unlikely, given the conditions on the ground.</p><p>The Syrian government has no incentive to make any meaningful concessions, and President Assad is increasingly confident that he can defeat the insurgency by force. The opposition does not hold a unified position, and lost most of its remaining leverage when government forces recaptured the city of Aleppo in November 2016. Jihadist factions under the umbrella of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham are still militarily dominant, particularly in the Idlib pocket of rebel-held territory, and are fundamentally opposed to reaching a settlement with the Iran-backed government in Damascus.</p><p>A race for the Iraqi border will probably break up the Islamic State''s remaining caliphate in 2017, but strengthen the position of Hay''a Tahrir al-Sham jihadists in north-western Syria</p><p>The areas that will be contested by all parties in the race to the Iraqi border include the last remaining stretch of continuous territory governed by the Islamic State along the River Euphrates. This will probably mean the breaking up of the Islamic State''s remaining caliphate before the end of the year, reducing its governance project to a string of isolated urban areas that will eventually be retaken by the Syrian government or US-backed SDF forces in the course of 2018.</p><p>Hay''a Tahrir al-Sham on the other hand is likely to benefit from the Astana de-escalation plan, as the reduction in government attacks against them will enable them to focus additional resources on consolidating their dominance vis-à-vis other rebel factions. The rebel-held Idlib pocket where the group is dominant has little strategic significance for the Syrian government, and the resources that would be required to re-establish control there make it unlikely to be recaptured before other priorities, such as Deir al-Zour and access to the Iraqi border, have been achieved. In fact, the government benefits from keeping that area under rebel control because that is where jihadist factions are strongest, providing a useful case for the government to delegitimise the entire opposition.</p><p>Columb Strack, Senior Analyst, Economics & Country Risk, IHS MarkitPosted 16 June 2017</p>', 'https://ihsmarkit.com/research-analysis/astana-de-escalation-plan.html');

The three suspects killed eight people and wounded at least 48 others, with an undisclosed number of ''walking wounded'' not requiring hospitalisation also treated following the attack. The Islamic State claimed the attack through its Amaq news agency on 4 June.</p><p>The attack marked the third major Islamist militant attack in the UK in less than three months, after a vehicle-impact attack and knife attack in Westminster on 22 March and a suicide improvised explosive device (IED) attack in Manchester on 22 May. The three attacks resulted in a total of 34 fatalities and more than 200 wounded.</p><p>Significance</p><p>The increased frequency of such attacks and their intensity likely indicates a substantial increase in the pool of potential attackers during that period, straining security forces'' capabilities to identify and monitor high-risk suspects and networks effectively. The Islamic State''s emergence as a global militant Islamist group has also led to more attractive calls to join an armed campaign, increasing the number of individuals willing to conduct attacks in the West in the name of the group but without formal or established organisational and operational links.</p><p>The weapons and tactics used fit within militant Islamist tactical trends observed for the UK. The combined vehicle-impact and knife attack was the same as the tactic employed by Khalid Masood, the perpetrator of the 22 March Westminster attack claimed by the Islamic State. Indeed, similar low-capability means are most likely to be employed in the UK due to factors such as strict gun control legislation and the poor availability of small-arms through both legal and illicit channels. JTIC continues to forecast that attacks utilising both low-capability weapons such as vehicles or knives, or in rarer cases improvised weapons, such as the type of IED used in the Manchester attack, remain the most likely.</p><p>Tactics</p><p>The London Bridge attack was particularly notable for being conducted by a group of three suspects, with both the Westminster and Manchester attacks conducted by a single person. Though investigations remain ongoing and it is unclear whether the attackers are part of a larger network, received external support, or were in communication with known militant groups, the size of the cell suggests a conspiracy and an immediately clear level of organisation, coordination, and planning. The low-capability weapons used in the attack, however, do not provide any indications of a wider support network, as they could have been sourced without assistance or raising suspicion. The Islamic State has also frequently encouraged the conducting of knife attacks in its English-language propaganda, including in recent issues of its Rumiyah magazine and Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP)''s Inspire. Additionally, the targeting of an entertainment area aligned with the Islamic State''s calls for attacks, and was similar to restaurant and bar targets selected by Islamic State militants in Paris on 13 November 2015.</p><p>Otso Iho, Senior Analyst, Jane''s Terrorism & Insurgency Centre (JTIC), Jane''s by IHS MarkitPosted 8 June 2017</p>', 'https://ihsmarkit.com/research-analysis/third-major-attack-in-the-uk-in-under-three-months-underlines-intensification-of-terrorism-threat.html');

(US Air Force)</p><p>Analysis by IHS Markit''s Conflict Monitor service shows that in the 12-month period between 1 April 2016 and 31 March 2017, 43% of Islamic State fighting in Syria was directed against President Bashar al-Assad''s forces. The United States-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) accounted for 17% of recorded fighting involving the Islamic State. The remaining 40% involved rival Sunni opposition groups, particularly those which formed part of the Turkey-backed Euphrates Shield coalition. While US-backed forces surround the northern city of Raqqa, the Islamic State is engaged in intense fighting with the Syrian government around the city of Palmyra, central Syria, and in other parts of Homs and Deir al-Zour provinces. IHS Markit assesses that broader US military intervention aimed at toppling the Assad government is unlikely, given the unacceptably high risk of escalation with Russian forces, which are heavily embedded with the Syrian Army (see Syria: 7 April 2017:Missile strikes on Syrian airbase re-establish US credibility, but raise interstate war risks as result of miscalculation).

Syrian government forces are severely overstretched and a further reduction in their capability, particularly of the air force, would most likely enable the Islamic State and other jihadist groups fighting with the Hay''a Tahrir al-Sham coalition to push into the more heavily populated western Syria, threatening cities such as Hama, Homs, and Damascus, the capital. If the Islamic State succeeds in capturing the Syrian government''s isolated and heavily contested garrison in Deir al-Zour, the group would have a new major population centre from which to run the "caliphate".

INSERT INTO wcc.janes_detail (title, content, href) VALUES ('London terrorist attack highlights vehicle-impact as most likely ''lone actor'' tactic for conducting mass-casualty attacks in UK', '<p>Otso Iho, Senior Analyst, Jane''s Terrorism and Insurgency Centre (JTIC) </p><p>A vehicle-impact attack on London''s Westminster Bridge and subsequent stabbing at Westminster Palace marked the most serious terrorism incident since the July 2005 attacks in London.</p><p>On 22 March at around 14:35hrs, a vehicle drove the length of London''s Westminster Bridge, mounting the pavement and hitting pedestrians. After hitting the perimeter fence of Westminster Palace, the assailant gained access to the parliament grounds and fatally stabbed a police officer, before being shot dead by police. According to BBC News on 23 March, at least four people including the attacker were killed and at least 29 wounded, with seven sustaining critical injuries. The attacker''s identity has yet to be revealed by police. The incident represents the most severe attack in the United Kingdom since the 7 July 2005 Al-Qaeda suicide attacks in London, when four attackers detonated improvised explosive devices (IED) on the transport network, killing 52 people and wounding several hundreds.</p><p>Expected tactic</p><p>The attack - which is being treated as Islamist terrorism by the Metropolitan Police - is in line with IHS Markit''s terrorism risk assessment that attacks in the UK are most likely to be conducted by lone actors, with attacks using vehicles and knives highlighted as a predominant tactic. It also followed several mass-casualty vehicle-impact attacks conducted in Europe in 2016, which signals an increasing use of the tactic by Islamist extremists. In Nice on 14 July 2016 (Bastille Day), Mohamed Lahouaiej-Bouhlel drove a truck into people on a promenade killing 86 people and wounding more than 300 others, while in Berlin on 19 December 2016 Anis Amri drove a truck into a Christmas market, killing 12 people and wounding 56 others. Though no group has yet claimed responsibility for the attack, it would not be unusual for the Islamic State to claim an attack without being intricately involved in its execution; the group has frequently called for such attacks to be conducted in the West over the past year.</p><p>Outlook and implications</p><p>Potential future terrorist attacks in London and the UK more broadly are most likely to follow a similar low-capability/high-impact pattern, with less likelihood of more complex and drawn out attacks being conducted by organised cells of multiple people. Strict gun-control laws in the UK, and the difficulty of acquiring automatic weapons even on the black market, decreases the likelihood of mass-casualty shooting attacks. The risk that vehicular attacks will therefore be used as the most likely tactic of lone actor intent on conducting mass casualty attacks in the UK is elevated. Crowded tourist attractions - particularly with wide open spaces and adjacent to high profile locations - remain the most likely to be targeted in the capital, as they are difficult to secure against such attacks. The attack and its prominent location has the potential to also negatively impact the tourism sector over the coming summer months, with London now demonstrably not immune from the types of attacks seen in other European countries in 2016.</p><p>Although there is no indication that the attack was conducted by more than one person, police have since raided a number of properties in London, Birmingham and elsewhere, arresting eight, reportedly in connection with Wednesday''s attack. Further raids are likely over the coming days, increasing risks of disruption to business, while the area around Westminster will remain cordoned off.

"Defence spending should recover to pre-financial crisis levels by 2018."</p><p>The Jane''s Defence Budgets team produces the annual Jane''s Defence Budgets Report every December. The report examines and forecasts defence expenditure for 105 countries and captures 99% of global defence spending.</p><p>Key findings from the 2016 Jane''s Defence Budgets Report</p><p></p><p>NATO and Western Europe: Security concerns boost growth</p><p>NATO defence expenditure increased in 2016 for the first time since 2010 as a result of an end to cuts in the United States and stronger growth in Europe.</p><p>A deteriorating security situation has caused Western European defence budgets to rise for the first time in six years. Approximately USD10 billion will be added to Western European defence budgets across the next five years.</p><p>"Fuelled by an increasingly uncertain security environment and growing international pressure, Western European defence spending increased for the first time since 2009 and we expect growth to continue to strengthen over the next decade," McGerty said. "However, growth could be set back if the region''s economic recovery is derailed by the ongoing difficulties in Southern Europe as well as uncertainty surrounding the United Kingdom''s negotiations to leave the European Union."</p><p>The combined defence budget for the EU in 2016 was USD219 billion. In 2020 the combined defence budget is expected to be USD230.4 billion, although by this point China''s defence budget will have overtaken it.</p><p>If a weaker pound persists, India will have spent more on defence than the United Kingdom by 2018, pushing it out of the top three. In 2015 the United Kingdom''s defence budget was USD53.5 billion. It slightly increased to USD53.8 billion in 2016 and is projected to rise to USD55.1 billion by 2020.</p><p>APAC - Shift to power projection</p><p></p><p>Defence spending in the APAC region has boomed in recent years, driven by economic expansion in the region. Rising tensions around the South China Sea could drive further growth.</p><p>Between 2011 and 2015 the key states surrounding the South China Sea spent USD166 billion on the procurement of defence equipment. Between 2016 and 2020 that number is expected to increase to USD250 billion, with priorities shifting towards air and naval capabilities.</p><p>"A key trend in APAC is the shift from a traditional focus on territorial defence towards power projection," said Craig Caffrey, principal analyst, Jane''s. "This is new for the region and is likely to increase military-to-military contact between states. Rising defence spending could therefore be indirectly responsible for increased tension within the region which in turn could spur faster budget growth."</p><p>China''s defence budget is projected to double within 10 years - from USD123 billion in 2010 to USD233 billion in 2020. By 2020 China''s defence budget will be about four times bigger than the United Kingdom''s and more than the combined spending of Western Europe. By 2025 China is expected to outspend all other states in the APAC region combined.</p><p>Japan''s defence budget will hover around the USD41 billion mark between now and 2020.  "Although the Abe administration has started to increase defence spending after a decade of cuts, there are still severe budgetary constraints in place in Japan," said Paul Burton, director, Jane''s. "Japan cannot realistically match the kind of budget growth we continue to see in China, so the government is focusing upon spending its defence budget more efficiently and trying to provide more capability for the same amount of money."</p><p>India: Modernisation drive pushes India above Saudi Arabia and Russia</p><p></p><p>In 2016 India passed Saudi Arabia and Russia to become the country with the fourth-biggest defence budget. With growth expected to accelerate over the next two years, India will become the third-largest defence budget globally in 2018, surpassing the United Kingdom.</p><p>"Procurement spending has been constrained in India over the last three years as personnel costs have increased," Caffrey said. "However, what we expect to see from 2017 onwards is a military focused on modernisation. India needs new equipment to fulfil its modernisation drive. Over the next three years, India will re-emerge as a key growth market for defence suppliers."</p><p>Middle East: Down, but not out </p><p>Despite fiscal concerns and a lower oil price, defence budgets in the Middle East are forecast to recover to the spending highs of 2014 by 2019 at the latest.</p><p>The Middle East was the fastest growing region in terms of defence spending between 2012 and 2014, although spending has since dipped due to the dramatic drop in oil prices. However, even at the ''low point'', regional defence spending in 2015 and 2016 will still be higher than 2013 figures.</p><p>"We''ve seen a pause in growth in the Gulf States as a result of the collapse in oil prices," Caffrey said. "However, generally speaking, defence has been protected from cuts due to regional instability. In the cases of Kuwait and Qatar, we''ve actually seen significant increases in defence spending."</p><p>Saudi Arabia''s defence budget dipped slightly from USD50.5 billion in 2015 to USD48.7 billion in 2016, while Algeria''s defence budget increases since 2010 pushed the country into the top-20 this year.</p><p>Baltics: The fastest growing region </p><p>Since the onset of the Ukraine crisis, defence investment in the Baltics has doubled and is expected to double again in the next two years.</p><p>"The profile of defence spending in the Baltics has changed dramatically in the past two years," McGerty said. In 2005 the region''s total defence spending came to USD930 million in real terms. By 2014 this had grown marginally to USD981 million, but by 2016 it had soared to USD1.45 billion.</p><p>"Their defence budgets will all be over 2% of GDP by 2018, and each country will have doubled or tripled their budgets from 10 years ago. Annual growth in the region reached 27% in 2016 and by 2020 the region''s defence spending will reach USD2.1 billion. This growth is faster than any other region globally," McGerty said.</p><p>Russia: Out of the top five </p><p>2015 is expected to represent the zenith of Russian defence expenditures for the foreseeable future. The 2016 budget included the first reduction in Russian defence expenditures since the late 1990s, as well as Russia dropping to the number six position - the first time it has been out of the top five in years. "The surge in Indian defence spending pushed Russia below Saudi Arabia and down into the number six slot," Caffrey said. "We expect the Russian defence budget to fall again next year and it will sit below France in the number seven positon by 2020, based on current plans, with a total defence budget of USD41.4 billion."</p><p>US: Still the world leader </p><p></p><p>In 2016 the US defence budget rose to USD622 billion from USD615.7 billion in 2015. The 2016 US figure represents about 40% of the year''s global defence spend.</p><p>"Since 9/11, over USD9.35 trillion has been allocated to the US defence budget, with the Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) accounting for USD1.62 trillion or 17.3% of the total US Department of Defense budget," said Guy Eastman, senior analyst, Jane''s. After the 2001 attacks a buildup took place through to 2010 to support operations in the Middle East and elsewhere, followed by decreasing OCO budgets and troop reductions, bringing the US Department of Defense (DoD) budget to the 2016 value of USD622 billion.</p><p>"US DoD investment levels going forward were to decrease by 1.1% in real terms, but with the election of Donald Trump, the expectation is that both investment and readiness will receive injections of much needed funds," Eastman said.</p><p>About 45% of investment funding will go toward procurement and modification of aircraft, ship, submarine, and military ground vehicle platforms. When the new administration took office in January 2017, actions toward the proposed goals to increase ground forces, and increased ship and tactical aircraft numbers and readiness levels commenced along with RDT&E investment in innovation, according to the Jane''s Defence Budgets Report.</p><p>Jane''s editorial staff Posted 15 March 2017</p>', 'https://ihsmarkit.com/research-analysis/2016s-usd157-trillion-global-defence-spend-to-kick-off-decade-of-growth.html');

According to documents published by the Combating Terrorism Center (CTC) on 31 January, the Islamic State had planned the weaponisation of UAVs since 2015 and stated that its UAV programme had become "institutionalised".</p><p></p><p>Above: a still from a video showing two Islamic State militants launching a Skywalker X7/8 UAV carrying two IEDs over the Tigris river.</p><p>Battlefield limitationsAlthough the use of UAVs in an attack context - both in dropping munitions and in booby-traps - has garnered significant media attention through the novelty attached to it, its use as an effective military weapon in a battlefield context is limited more to symbolic and propaganda use. The commercially available and improvised UAVs used by the Islamic State - including fixed-wing Skywalker X7s or similar, and quadcopter-type UAVs - offer relatively small payloads, typically approximately 1-2 kg. Although 1-2 kg of explosives could cause significant damage, this payload also has to include cameras and other navigational systems, meaning at least half of the payload could be used for explosives.</p><p>Although the Islamic State has frequently used UAVs in its propaganda releases, at the time of writing they have not been widely promoted by the group as a potential weapon to be used by its followers in the same way as knives, vehicles, and IEDs. For example, such mentions have been absent from its English-language magazines Rumiyah and Dabiq.</p><p>Counter-measuresGovernments and militaries have developed a range of counter-measures to deal with the threat posed by UAVs. The vast majority of such solutions employ electronic means - typically jamming - to disable the vehicle or take control of it, if possible.</p><p>OutlookThe emergence of more advanced and cheaper UAVs and their increasing deployment by nonstate armed groups in conflict zones has made it imperative for security forces to prepare for the risk posed by these technologies. Although no such attack has been conducted in the West to date, the availability, cost, relative ease of use, and wide range of operational applications make UAVs an attractive new tool for militants. The force multiplier and value-add from a militant group''s perspective is enhanced by the propaganda value afforded by a UAV-facilitated attack, as well as the footage that can be recorded of such attacks and exploited for propaganda and recruitment purposes.</p><p>Jane''s editorial staff Posted 6 March 2017</p>', 'https://ihsmarkit.com/research-analysis/game-of-drones-the-uses-of-uavs-by-militant-groups-in-iraq-and-syria.html');

It is most comparable in function to the former Soviet Committee for State Security (Komitet gosudarstvennoy bezopasnosti: KGB). Its primary missions are to protect Kim and the Kim family and to ensure the political stability of North Korea.</p><p>Ministry of People''s Security: The Ministry of People''s Security (MPS) functions primarily as the national police and civil defence force for North Korea.

The size and variety of the Chinese delegation at this year''s event has stood out.</p><p>While the US, UAE and Western European pavilions all are larger, the sheer number and variety of Chinese companies at IDEX 2017 is intriguing: from large state-owned enterprises selling higher-end military capabilities, such as cruise missiles, unmanned systems, directed energy weapons, advanced torpedos, tanks and naval platforms to an array of smaller firms selling more mundane items such as military clothing.</p><p>China''s growing presence at one of the region''s largest and most influential shows reflects the intersection of a series of supply and demand-side trends that are slowly but surely reshaping the competitive dynamics of one of the most important export markets in the world.</p><p>On the supply side, China has actively sought to boost its defence exports during the 2010s. This effort is in part a means of injecting more cash into an already well-funded industry seeking to cut the innovation and technology gap with the most advanced Western defense industry organizations, especially those in the United States. More significantly, though, China''s efforts to build defense exports are primarily part of a broader effort to deepen geopolitical relationships with states and regions deemed to be strategically valuable. China''s growing demand for energy and general desire to play an enhanced role in geopolitics outside its immediate vicinity make building defense relationships in the Middle East a priority.</p><p>The region has mostly welcomed China''s initial attempts at market penetration-along with many other non-Western providers-as states in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) attempt to balance multiple defense, security and budgetary exigencies.</p><p>The precipitous drop in oil prices from 2014 halted the forward momentum in defense spending of most - but not quite all, Qatar and Kuwait have been notable exceptions-of the GCC states. In the years leading up to the oil market crash, the GCC states had become the fastest growing export market in the world due in large part to the kaleidoscopically complex, overlapping and multi-dimensional threats facing the region and high oil prices. The GCC had a compelling need and it had the resources to meet its requirements. While Jane''s expects GCC defense budgets to return to growth in 2017 and to exceed pre-2015 levels by the end of the decade, the stabilization of energy prices between $50 - $60 has placed enhanced emphasis on some degree of fiscal responsibility in defense spending, where possible.</p><p>New competition, new threats </p><p>GCC states will continue to engage the United States and other advanced and established Western suppliers on a range of high-value procurements-especially areas where the highest-end and most reliable technologies are absolutely critical to national security and sovereignty (for example, layered missile defense). However, the market is increasingly marked by a growing threat environment and therefore by new levels of competition across a broader range of procurements. GCC defense and security organizations are diversifying their supplier base in response to the combination of growing demand and somewhat constrained budgets and in some cases procuring "good enough", but more affordable, platforms and systems from a longer list of suppliers.</p><p>Saudi Arabia''s 2016 selection of a company from the Republic of Georgia to provide armored ambulances over several North American providers serves as an indicative example as does Saudi Arabia''s recent discussions with Pakistan about importing Pakistani made main battle tanks. China has been particularly successful in exporting unmanned aerial systems to the region as well.</p><p>Initial GCC efforts to diversify its defense supplier base where possible have been amplified by uncertainty of the US posture toward and commitment to the region as well as heightened political resistance in both the United States and Western Europe to arms sales to the region.</p><p>Strategic concern over US commitment began during the Obama Administration, especially after the announcement of the strategy to rebalance US naval forces to Asia. The election of Donald J. Trump as President of the United States in November of 2016 and the subsequent articulation of provocative and potentially destabilizing policies on region-relevant issues such as managing immigration from the Middle East, confronting Iran, negotiating peace between Israel and the Palestinians and combating Daesh and the broader radical Islamist extremist terrorist threat has intensified the overarching sense of uncertainty about U.S. policy among GCC states and the broader region.</p><p>Offsets and technology transfers key selling points </p><p>China and other exporters-both established and emerging-from Russia, Western Europe, Eastern Europe and across Asia have also been able to take advantage of the increasing efforts of several GCC states, particularly the UAE, but also Saudi Arabia and possibly others, to build their own indigenous defense industrial bases through offsets and technology transfers. China is near the top of the list of national industrial bases stressing flexibility in its approach to export markets, especially in the area of cost, workshare, technology transfer and training of local industrial bases.</p><p>The end result of these supply and demand trends is a GCC market coping with several transitions. As GCC states balance the need for more capabilities to mitigate against increased risk all while adjusting to a new, though far from desperate, fiscal environment, opportunities are likely to emerge for new suppliers. Commitment to the region is critical, and the GCC market is not one that will open up overnight. Established providers with established relationships and histories of successful delivery will maintain an advantage. But the "China Defence" presence at 2017 is a signal of intent of just one more national industry seeking to position itself in what may soon become a savagely competitive market.</p><p>Tate Nurkin, Senior Director, Strategic Assessments and Futures Studies, Jane''s by IHS MarkitPosted 24 February 2017</p>', 'https://ihsmarkit.com/research-analysis/idex-2017-analysis-and-wrap-up.html');

As a result, these innovations will generate disruptive shifts in the ''realm of the possible'' for the global aerospace, space and defense industry; militaries; and national security and intelligence communities around the world.</p><p>The ''Materials Revolution'': Going Small to Go Big</p><p>Many materials have exceptionally dynamic and useful properties at the atomic or, in the case of biomaterials, genome level that they lose naturally at the macro or micro level. The list of disruptive and innovative atomic/individual genome-level properties of interest to aerospace and defense industry companies and the markets they support is long and growing longer. Much attention has been focused on properties that enable self-healing; adaptation to environmental conditions or external stimuli; extreme speed, resilience and strength at (frequently much) lower weights; natural or highly efficient storage or diffusion of energy; and enhanced low observability.</p><p></p><p>As scientists and engineers have sought to develop novel materials to drive entirely new capabilities, they have worked to capture and control the properties displayed at this most fundamental level in constructing larger scale materials. These processes remain technological challenges - especially given the complexity and unpredictability of bio-systems - yet to be fully conquered.</p><p>However, progress is being made (as are increasingly large and more focused investments by aerospace, space and defense communities and industries) in creating new materials consisting of components broken down to their smallest levels before being built back up in order to achieve ''big'' and potentially game-changing effects.</p><p></p><p>Manufacturing Revolution: Reinforcing Innovation and Driving Scale through Precision and Automation</p><p>Effectively leveraging the growing ability to design these new materials with novel properties is reliant on the concurrent development of new means of building and manufacturing at scale products with a new level of precision and customization.</p><p>Additive manufacturing is likely to be a critical component of this process because it allows for the sort of precision necessary to build end-products, fraction-of-an-inch-by-fraction-of-a-customized-inch, from multiple delicately engineered smart or biomaterials.</p><p>Automation, too, is a critical component of the emerging Manufacturing Revolution. For example, in synthetic biology, the hard work of building entirely new DNA sequences and bio-systems has long been more an art than a scalable process, taking weeks or more of isolated individual tests to determine the properties of new bio-systems. The increasingly robust--but still not mature - ability to develop entirely new biologies using computer aided design software and the accumulated knowledge of tens of thousands or more of replicable and repeatable tests could be a massive step forward for synthetic biology manufacturing - moving the design and development of highly-customized effects from an artisanal craft to an automated industry.</p><p></p><p>The ''Assembly'' Revolution</p><p>BionicOpter DragonflyRevolutionary efficiencies and performance enhancements could also be gained by removing the ''Assembly'' stage from the manufacturing process in the chart above, a development enabled by the use of 3D printers or synthetic biology manufacturing. Removing assembly can increase robustness of parts, platforms and products - fewer joints and rivets can provide more structural integrity - reduce costs and shorten manufacturing timelines. It will also almost certainly lead to an increase in point-of-use production, which could have revolutionary implications for consumer habits, business supply chains, space exploration and, of course, military operations around the world.</p><p></p><p>Novel Confluences and the Dawn of the ''Design Age''</p><p>The intersection of these prospective revolutions is driving shifts not only in manufacturing models, but also in the conceptualisation of what types of products and capabilities - military, commercial, civil - are now possible. If and as these transformative capabilities in materials and manufacturing continue and collide - as they are doing in very constructive ways through 4D printing - long-standing constraints on design (on what is within the realm of the possible) will be smashed, or, at the very least, challenged in stark and destabilizing ways.</p><p>The end result could be the ushering in of the ''Design Age'' in which manufacturing processes and material properties will be seen as powerful enablers of constructive innovations in capabilities and products rather than constraints.</p><p>Tate Nurkin, Senior Director, Strategic Assessments and Futures Studies, Jane''s by IHS MarkitPosted 17 February 2017</p>', 'https://ihsmarkit.com/research-analysis/the-design-age-technology-trends-and-intersections-driving-the-next-industrial-age.html');

This phenomenon - broadly, citizens'' feeling of growing estrangement from their political and economic elites - was illustrated in two events that will shape the global security outlook in 2017 and beyond: the UK''s referendum vote on 23 June to withdraw from the European Union, and the election of Trump as president.</p><p>2016 was one of the most disruptive years of the post-Cold War period</p><p>The victory of Donald Trump in the US presidential election on 8 November defied the predictions of pollsters and analysts in the most significant upset in the modern history of the United States. It helped to define 2016 as one of the most disruptive years of the post-Cold War period, marked by events such as the UK voting to leave the European Union, Russia upscaling its military involvement in Crimea and Syria, a wave of attacks in European cities previously untouched by Islamist terrorism, North Korea intensifying the pace of its nuclear device and ballistic missile testing, and a failed coup and government crackdown in Turkey.</p><p>Thematic threats trend: Given the intent and capability of terrorist groups, an increasing risk of nuclear weapons use, and technological innovations placing advanced capabilities in the hands of non-state actors.</p><p></p><p>Shifting borders trend: In parts of the Middle East and Central Europe, the territorial integrity of states is being challenged with increasing frequency in a way that often either involves armed conflict or increases the likelihood of future conflicts. More broadly, by undermining the principle of territorial integrity as reflected in international law, the future threshold for similar challenges to territorial integrity is reduced.</p><p></p><p>Evolving warfare trend: A security trend where a marked consolidation occurred in 2016 was in the prosecution of warfare - both in the physical battlespace and the cyber-domain - by state and non-state actors. Many national security doctrines now explicitly hold that cyberspace is simply an extension of ''real world'' conflict theatres: even as states publicly discuss the merits of establishing cyber norms of íbehaviour (such as in the UN Group of Governmental Experts), they covertly develop, maintain, and deploy offensive and defensive cyber capabilities.</p><p>Below - Pro-Russian militants gather in front of the home of Ukrainian tycoon Rinat Akhmetov in Donetsk, eastern Ukraine, on 25 May 2014. An overarching driver behind new concepts of warfare is deniability.</p><p></p><p>Changing alliances trend: After the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, NATO''s purpose was called into question. In the wake of the 2001 terrorist attacks on the US, it sought to reorient itself towards tackling security threats such as terrorism, but also other non-state threats such as people smuggling. This trajectory changed again, initially following the Russian invasion of Georgia and then sharply following the Russian invasion of Crimea using deniable warfare, both of which led to shifts in de facto borders. By the end of 2016, NATO was again positioning itself primarily as a collective defence alliance to deter Russian aggression in Europe.</p><p>Outlook</p><p>How the world looks at the end of 2017 will largely depend on the actions taken by one man in the early months of the year. With the US facing the greatest challenge to its superpower status since the era of the Soviet Union, Trump''s policy decisions in the earliest days of his presidency will shape the direction that many events take in 2017. Yet Trump will take up the presidency as a largely unknown quantity in foreign and security policy, with no legislative voting record, military or diplomatic service, policy white papers, or history of engaging with world leaders.</p>', 'https://ihsmarkit.com/research-analysis/significant-security-consequences-that-could-take-place-in-2017.html');

Identifying enablers of success across multiple scenarios allows organizations to build flexibility and adaptability into strategic and operational plans.</p><p>Three alternative visions for the future of the global defence and security industry:</p><p>1. Industry InsurgencyThis is a scenario largely focused on radical shifts in both supply and demand dynamics in the global export market. The scenario envisions growing global growth in defence spending, especially in emerging markets. It also posits tiers of new competitors enter the export market en force in the early-to-mid 2020s. The combined result is a fundamental squeezing of established providers market position requiring a rethink of strategy and business models across the industry.</p><p>First tier ''full spectrum'' competitors reach ''full / cross - spectrum'' competitive maturity between around 2022 and 2028. Simultaneously, several niche competitors-both in terms of capabilities and specific geographic focus areas-will constitute a more significant competitive presence. Some countries'' will have ambitions that outstrip their industrial capacity, creating a different type of export challenge.</p><p>2. Divergent DisruptionsThis is an exceptionally fast - paced scenario marked by rapid high-end and low-end asymmetric technological innovation in order to meet shifting end-user requirements. This scenario stresses the ''promise and peril'' of new technologies and the pressures on industry that rapid innovation and incorporation of novel technologies to meet requirements of an expanding and complex threat environment produces.</p><p>3. Failing FrameworksThis is a scenario of transition from the Western-led frameworks that have dominated global economics, geopolitics, and security since the end of World War II to a new order that does not fully form during the 20 year-plus scenario timeframe.</p><p>Shifting geopolitical alliances create novel and affecting pressures on the global defence industry. New industry relationships form-many emerging export markets will focus on diversifying supplier bases as a hedge against changing geopolitical alignments that could upset defence relationships-and with them new procurement priorities and supplier / end-user models.</p><p>Incorporating uncertainty in current and future strategic planning</p><p>Scenario planning is a powerful and increasingly relevant means of incorporating uncertainty, challenging assumptions, and expanding thinking about the future. By developing and examining pathways to and parameters of a series of alternative plausible (as opposed to merely likely) environments, decision-makers can better understand how drivers might evolve and/or intersect to create novel landscapes.</p><p>Jane''s Defence Industry 20YY scenario planning product has developed three alternative visions for the future of the global defence and security industry (and analysis of these futures), each designed to isolate a particularly powerful driver or intersection of drivers.

Current planning processes built around predictive forecasts of the probable will not be sufficient. Companies need to augment their forecasts with methods that stress proactively incorporating - rather than eliminating - uncertainty. Businesses that resist innovative thinking and processes will find themselves caught flat footed by fast-moving shifts.</p><p>There are many sources of business disruption but three stand out:</p><p>The ability to respond rapidly to multidimensional disruptions is critical to driving business success. Indeed, the rate of change in today''s connected and complex world can occur faster than many conventional decision- making processes are equipped to manage.</p><p>Forecasting has long been the primary tool for identifying "known factors" to predict the future and set strategy. However, forecasts are typically based on historical trends and assumptions that are less likely to be valid for understanding the future during periods of disruption.</p><p>Consider forecasting future energy demand. Since 1990 the share of fossil fuels in total global energy consumption has held remarkably steady, at around 80 percent. The future, however, will not follow historical trends. The confluence of new technologies, geopolitical realities, market dynamics, and regulations - such as the 2016 Paris Climate Agreement - ensure the path forward for energy companies will be fraught with challenges. However, for some savvy and adaptable companies, it could also mean opportunities.</p><p>Likewise, in the automotive industry, the connected car, autonomous driving and new patterns of urban mobility are creating existential market and competitive uncertainties for some automakers.</p><p>"Living in the Futures" by Angela Wilkinson and Roland Kupers,Harvard Business Review,May 2013</p><p>New tools for strategic resilience</p><p>Regardless of industry, the need for resiliency in an era of disruption is driving companies to embrace scenario planning and make it an integral part of their strategic planning processes. By expanding the range of possible futures considered - from probable outcomes to less likely but plausible ones - companies can systematically develop an understanding of how to make their business strategies more resilient.</p><p>Long used by national security organizations to inform competitive strategies and anticipate threats, scenario planning allows management to test deeply held assumptions about their business and understand the various pathways along which the future may unfold, and how they should act or react to remain competitive. Scenario planning complements - but not replaces - traditional analysis, expertise and trend monitoring, and offers a nuanced view of possible future worlds.</p><p>To stress test scenarios, companies typically use "strategy" or "tabletop" gaming, also known as war gaming in the military where the methodology originated. Gaming asks stakeholders to "play out" over hours or days specific scenarios that in the real world may unfold over a span of months or years. They are especially useful in understanding the interactions between and implications of a given company''s strategy and the behaviors and decisions of customers and competitors.</p><p>One of the most important outputs of any well- executed scenario planning exercise is the identification of signposts, or indicators, that one scenario or category of scenarios is more or less likely to come to pass. When signpost identification is matched with scenario-specific hedging strategies, organizations can move to enhance resilience before the disruptions emerge and markets shift, rather than after the fact.</p><p>Elements of successful scenario planning</p><p>While scenario planning and gaming take different forms and seek to achieve different objectives, they both stress collaboration and teamwork to improve decision making by challenging assumptions and expanding the scope of alternative outcomes that the company should consider.</p><p>To get the most out of strategy gaming, organizations need to establish ground rules that create an environment free of risk or repercussions for novel thinking, encourage free exchange of ideas and opinions, and foster creativity, honesty and trust among participants. Three recommendations for successful gaming outcomes are:</p><p>Scenario planning and gaming are powerful tools for evaluating the complexity of new competitive threats in ways traditional tools cannot. Incorporating scenario planning into the formal strategic planning process provides a more nuanced understanding of possible futures that can reveal new opportunities and set the stage for driving competitive advantage.</p><p>Tate Nurkin is Managing Director, Consulting and Thought Leadership, IHS Aerospace, Defense and SecurityPosted 7 December 2016</p>', 'https://ihsmarkit.com/research-analysis/planning-for-multiple-futures.html');
