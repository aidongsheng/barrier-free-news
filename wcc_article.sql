His only balm the tender words he reads over and over again. The familiar voice of his beloved daughter calling out from between the lines of her immaculate handwritten script.</p><p>‘Daddy, I don’t express as often as I should how much you mean to me,’ writes Meghan. ‘Everything you do for me has turned me into who I am and I am so grateful.’</p><p>In one of the last notes she sent, just months before she met Prince Harry, Meghan signed off: ‘I love you with all of my heart now and forever. Love Bean’ – her childhood nickname.</p><p>Each heartfelt word reveals the true sentiments of a devoted daughter. Meghan’s love for Thomas Markle is as plain as day.</p><p>Yet today he is a pariah. At 74, in failing health in his twilight years, he is spending Christmas ostracised by his daughter. Heartbroken, cut off and cast out into the cold by an angry and indignant Meghan.</p><p>The irony will be lost on the new Duchess of Sussex, as she fine-tunes her favoured philanthropic causes, that charity, as the saying goes, should begin at home. But to her, Thomas has become an embarrassment and a rolling public humiliation.</p><p>Unable to manage and control him, she has pulled up the drawbridge. Behind the castle walls she will not – cannot – be reached. While Thomas feels wounded, Meghan feels betrayed. She is unwilling to climb down from the battlements. Meghan’s Royal ambition is leaving a large and untidy wake.</p><p>She has in the past been accused of using people and then quickly moving on up the ladder, never looking back.</p><p>It may be harsh to say she’s ‘ghosting’ her father – the fashionable term used when someone cuts off all communication without warning or explanation. Thomas prefers to describe her behaviour as ‘acting up’. But what’s certain is that she has approached her new Royal life at full tilt, head down, powering through.</p><p>As Thomas says: ‘She was a control freak but never in a bad way – she was always sweet and kind.’</p><p>Meghan’s marriage to Prince Harry wasn’t simply falling in love – although that was the main impetus – it was a life transformation of unimaginable proportions.</p><p>A girl raised in a series of Los Angeles apartment blocks, who reinvented herself as a successful TV actress, is now reinventing herself as a princess.</p><p>Since joining the House of Windsor her personal style has got more regal and refined. She has made sure social issues are front and centre of her public persona, like her high-profile cookbook launch to help Grenfell survivors with mum Doria in tow. And, of course, she plays the Royal wife with aplomb, as we have seen on the couple’s dazzling tour to Australia and New Zealand. She is, as one source says, ‘putting everything into this’. And as Thomas observes, his perfectionist daughter has always liked to micro-manage her life.</p><p>Meghan knew her arrival in the Royal circle would be tricky. A divorcee, a woman with history, there was always the chance of a disgruntled ex speaking out.</p><p>What no one expected – and what has repeatedly wrong-footed Palace officials – is that it would be her immediate family who would prove to be the headache.</p><p>While Doria has been the personification of discretion, Meghan views her father’s meandering outbursts during this critical time as a reminder of where she came from – not where she’s going. And right now, she finds it unforgivable. A post she shared on her old lifestyle blog The Tig gives a telling insight into how she deals with such ‘negative experiences’.</p><p>She quoted Portuguese life coach José Micard Teixeira, who wrote: ‘I no longer have patience for certain things, not because I’ve become arrogant, but simply because I reached a point in my life where I do not want to waste more time with what displeases me or hurts me. I lost the will to please those who do not like me, to love those who do not love me and to smile at those who do not want to smile at me.’</p><p>This philosophy still drives Meghan’s thinking and has been firmly applied to her father’s behaviour.</p><p>Thomas Markle admits to ‘stupid mistakes’, including posing for paparazzi pictures before the Royal Wedding, but says that being frozen out by Meghan and Harry ‘is a punishment which does not fit the crime’. He has apologised repeatedly for the pictures, which included one of him being measured for a wedding suit.</p><p>‘I was a fool. I was convinced to do these pictures to change my image. I was sick of seeing schlubby pictures of me buying beer which wasn’t even for me,’ he says.</p><p>‘I apologised to Harry on the phone and all he said was, “If you’d listened to me, none of this would have happened.” I did a few things wrong, said a few things I should not have said. But some of the Royals have done far worse things… There are convicts in prisons who have murdered and committed all kinds of horrible crimes, and their daughters still visit them.’</p><p>From day one she has appeared to play favourites with her parents – Doria got an official Palace scroll announcing their wedding, Thomas didn’t. Doria was formally invited to the nuptials, Thomas wasn’t. And he was very hurt when told he couldn’t make a speech at the reception.</p><p>In most family feuds, it takes a third party – a husband or partner – to intervene, break the entrenched positions and tactfully suggest the offer of an olive branch might be the best way forward.</p><p>Harry should have been that peacemaker. But headstrong, unworldly and in thrall to his starry, beautiful wife he did nothing to calm the brewing storm.</p><p>Rather than respectfully meeting his father-in-law face to face before the couple’s engagement was announced, he chose a quick chat on the phone. Harry – or rather his advisers – had the chance to bring Thomas into the Royal tent before the world even knew Meghan and Harry were a couple. It was a dropped ball that has led us to this point.</p><p>When, only days before the wedding, Thomas foolishly agreed to stunt some photographs, Harry was on the phone again, this time to severely berate him. Thomas, recovering from urgent heart surgery and deeply embarrassed by his actions, pulled out of his daughter’s big day. Some Royal insiders suggested he faked the surgery to find an excuse, but, as we reveal today, it actually saved his life.</p><p>For Meghan, the joy of her Windsor Castle wedding shared by the world was a chance to put all the unpleasantness behind her. She decided to take a ‘time out’ from her Dad, but neglected to communicate that to him properly. Once again, he felt hurt and slighted and reacted angrily in a live TV interview.</p><p>Right now it’s hard to see Meghan giving ground. Just in practical terms she is heavily pregnant, working with interior designers and armed with swatch fabric and paint samples, to redevelop the couple’s new home, Frogmore Cottage, in time for the spring birth. She won’t be jumping on a plane to Mexico to make peace with her father in those circumstances. But with Thomas in ailing health, Harry needs to man up and fix what he inadvertently set off in the first place by failing to show Meghan’s father the necessary respect. Only then will Meghan and her father be reunited.</p><p>Time is a great healer – but time is also something that we can never have enough of. Harry and Prince William spoke movingly last year of how they are haunted by their last hurried phone call to their mother, Princess Diana, the evening before she died.</p><p>They were eager to get off the phone because they were having such a great time playing with their cousins at Balmoral. Harry said in an interview: ‘I can’t really necessarily remember what I said but all I do remember is probably regretting for the rest of my life how short the phone call was.’</p><p>It’s a sentiment we have all felt in one way or another. A visit we never made, a call not returned, and suddenly the chance to say what we wanted to say is gone for ever.</p><p>Meghan is at heart a good and generous woman who is ambitious and could be critical in the reinvention of the Royal Family for another generation.</p><p>But what she cannot be is forever cast as the cruelly unforgiving daughter of a heartbroken and lonely old man.</p><p>And Harry holds the key to making sure that doesn’t happen – before it’s too late.</p>', 'https://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-6475323/TINA-WEAVER-Man-Prince-Harry-heal-rift-Meghans-father-late.html');

Next, her sister Dawn, two, had her throat slit.</p><p>Then their four-year-old brother Paul was strangled with wire. The children were also beaten with a pickaxe handle and their battered bodies impaled on a neighbour''s garden fence.</p><p>The murderer was David McGreavy, a family friend and lodger, who was babysitting. </p><p>He blamed his murderous spree on Samantha''s crying for her milk bottle that evening – Friday, April 13, 1973. He was also drunk.</p><p>The children''s mother, Elsie, was out doing a part-time job in the local pub to earn extra cash – the family were saving to buy their own home. </p><p>Her husband Clive went to collect her and asked McGreavy to keep an eye on the children.</p><p>Then 21, he had been lodging with the family after falling out with his own parents. Occasionally he''d cook Sunday lunch and even shared a room with young Paul. </p><p>There were no hint of the horrors to come.</p><p>''He played with the children – he was normal,'' recalls Elsie.</p><p>But his subsequent outburst wasn''t just a hot-tempered spasm. It was a sustained attack on three defenceless children, ending in a sickening, public display of evil.</p><p>''All I can hear is kids, kids, kids,'' he told police.</p><p>The Parole Board''s explanation for freeing him is so glibly inadequate that they could be describing a serial speeding offender. </p><p>They say that McGreavy, now 67, has ''changed considerably'', and has ''developed self-control… to remain calm in stressful situations''.</p><p>After interviewing McGreavy, and a psychologist who examined him, the Board concluded that he is ''no significant risk to the public''.</p><p>I grew up not far from where Samantha, Dawn and Paul were killed. </p><p>To my mother''s generation, McGreavy was known locally as the ''Monster of Worcester'', as infamous as the Moors Murderers.</p><p>But because he admitted his crimes (the court case lasted just eight minutes) he did not gain wider notoriety. I''d never heard of him until last week.</p><p>As McGreavy looks forward to freedom, Elsie exists in a tortuous twilight world.</p><p>Her marriage collapsed soon after the killings and she has attempted suicide twice.</p><p>Her only comfort is believing she''ll be reunited with her children one day. Of course, she wrote to the Parole Board but the pleas of victims carry little weight.</p><p>''I see my children''s faces every night when I close my eyes and try to sleep'', she says. ''How can the Parole Board decide he''s served his sentence when mine will never end?''</p><p>Of course, such decisions must be made on professional assessment, not emotion. </p><p>But I don''t believe any psychologist can really know what lurks in the deepest recesses of the brain to make someone capable of such savagery.</p><p>McGreavy will be institutionalised after so long in prison so it''s impossible to predict how he will respond to life on the outside. </p><p>Yet the Parole Board think it''s worth the risk.</p><p>After Christmas, McGreavy will go to a bail hostel where he will be closely monitored.</p><p>My god-daughter works in a similar halfway house, supervising murderers and child sex offenders. </p><p>When I asked what they were like, she replied ''manipulative'', adding: ''They''re clever, scheming and will do what it takes to be freed.''</p><p>Christmas is the grimmest time for Elsie. ''It hurts so much because I feel what would have been if my children would have been there'', she says.</p><p>But for the Monster of Worcester, this Christmas will most likely be his best ever.</p><p>A harassed working mum struggles to prepare her children’s breakfast and get herself to the office.</p><p>Lost keys, a plaintive text from her teenage boy (sitting just feet away) asking to meet later, and then frenetic cross-cutting as we see how unhappy mother and son have become. </p><p>Finally, a fairytale freeze frame as the mother realises her priority and runs from the office to meet her boy at the funfair. </p><p>This is the tear-jerking BBC Christmas promo which has been charged with ‘guilting’ working mothers and suggesting the responsibility for parenting is solely women’s – not men’s.</p><p>As the mum of a teenage son, with a husband who is his stepfather, this could have been a morning clip from our home. </p><p>I still remember my eldest child’s tears when a younger me hurriedly phoned from work to say goodnight. </p><p>The school play I had to skip. Me explaining that mummy’s job buys his Lego – and him heartbreakingly packing it up to take back, so I didn’t have to work.</p><p>And, yes, the guilt of being a working mother never goes away.</p><p>But the reality of today’s world means few of us can afford to do otherwise.

The guests were welcomed with a gift of a small fabric bag containing a welcome note from Meghan and Trevor along with a small plastic ‘baggy’ of marijuana. Mr Markle says: ‘It’s illegal, but it’s no big deal in Jamaica. It’s almost customary down there. I don’t smoke weed and to the best of my knowledge nor does Meghan. I don’t know what I did with mine. I think I gave it away. I kept the bag and I use it to keep the sea air [at his Mexican beachside home] off one of my Emmys.’ He has won three of the awards, known as the TV Oscars.</p><p>Festivities included ‘beach yoga with Doria’ – while she is now well known, she was listed simply as ‘Meg’s mum’ on the invitation.</p><p>The Jamaica Inn is famous as the honeymoon designation of Hollywood star Marilyn Monroe and her third husband, playwright Arthur Miller, and was a regular haunt of James Bond author Ian Fleming. ‘If it’s good enough for Marilyn Monroe and Arthur Miller… it’s good enough for us,’ read the invitation.</p><p>On the day before the ‘beach chic’ wedding, the couple hosted ‘beach Olympics’ featuring the bride’s team versus the groom’s team in events such as tug-of-war and kayaking, followed by a barbecue. That night everyone danced to a reggae band.</p><p>Mr Markle, who helped pay for the celebration, is mentioned twice in the wedding literature. He is credited with ‘generously hosting’ brunch on the final day and gets a special ‘thank you’ for his ‘incredible generosity’.</p><p>Guests who chose not to stay at the Jamaica Inn were offered alternative accommodation nearby at The Royal Plantation.</p><p>The wedding invitation reads: ‘Cheers to love, cheers to laughter, cheers to happily ever after.’ Two years later, the marriage was over.  </p>', 'https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6475347/Thomas-Markle-unveils-touching-photograph-proves-DID-daughters-wedding.html');

So what are the scientifically proven ways to stay sparkling this festive season?</p><p>First, if you want to avoid embarrassment at the office party, have a glass of milk or handful of nuts before you go out.</p><p>When you chug down a glass of alcohol it swiftly passes into your stomach. If it’s empty then the alcohol will irritate your stomach lining, making blood vessels swell, increasing the speed and amount of alcohol that is absorbed into your blood. This is why you get drunk faster if you haven’t eaten.</p><p>If you eat before you drink, particularly something fatty – instead of nuts or milk it could be cheese – this will act as a physical barrier to the booze, and instead of being absorbed in the stomach the alcohol passes through a valve called the pyloric sphincter and into your small intestine.</p><p>Going this route, it takes longer to get into your blood stream, and so to your brain.</p><p>But will mixing your drinks make you more drunk? Broadly, no. How drunk you get is mainly down to how much alcohol you drink, though fizzy drinks are the exception – champagne bubbles seem to get you drunk faster. One theory is that carbon dioxide in the bubbles somehow speeds the absorption of alcohol.</p><p>Once alcohol hits your brain, it depresses your inhibitory centres. When I drink I normally have about an hour of uninhibited fun, before I slump.</p><p>Alcohol is toxic, so your liver puts aside all other work and starts breaking it down, turning it into a toxic substance called acetaldehyde. This then gets converted into vinegar (acetic acid) and eventually into carbon dioxide and water. It is the build-up of acetaldehyde that causes flushing when we drink and, later on, makes hangovers such a horrible experience.</p><p>I can’t handle much alcohol, and that seems to be genetic. I’ve been tested and I, like ten per cent of Europeans, have a dodgy version of an enzyme called acetaldehyde dehydrogenase, which speeds up the removal of acetaldehyde. That’s why when I drink more than a very modest amount I flush and feel terrible.</p><p>Considering how bad alcohol makes me feel, my wife, Clare, is astonished that I drink at all. She is not a big drinker, which is just as well, because women tend to get drunk faster – partly because they tend to be smaller, but they have less muscle and more body fat than men. Some alcohol gets absorbed by your muscles, but fat and alcohol don’t mix.</p><p>Hormones also play a part in metabolising alcohol and a woman who goes drinking just before her period will find she needs less booze to have the same effect.</p><p>Most of the herbs, potions and old wives’ tales touted around as hangover cures have little if no effect. An international group of scientists have pooled their expertise to form The Alcohol Hangover Research Group, who meet annually to discuss latest research, identify causes and look for potential treatments. So far, no remedies for the ‘general feeling of misery’ have been identified – aside from time.</p><p>If I have had too many drinks I drink a large glass of water and take a couple of paracetamol before heading for bed.</p><p>The head-splitting headache that accompanies a typical hangover is partly caused by dehydration. Next morning, soon after I stagger out of bed, I drink lots of tea, water and take another couple of paracetamol. I have an orange to try to replace a bit of Vitamin C and if I’m up to it, a greasy breakfast. Then, with a silent vow of ‘never again’, I take the dog for a walk.</p><p>Drinking too much alcohol is a serious social problem, so is there anything you can take that will help you cut back?</p><p>A few years ago, I took part in an experiment where we decided to test out a plant extract called kudzu, which you can buy in supplement form.</p><p>The plant seems to increase blood flow to the brain, so people feel the effects of alcohol more quickly. In theory this should slow down drinking.</p><p>We recruited a group of young men and women willing to have two nights out in the name of science. Before starting we gave them pills to swallow – some got a kudzu extract, others a placebo. A couple of hours after taking the pills, we gave them free access to a bar for 90 minutes, with a choice of beer, wine or spirits.</p><p>When they swallowed a placebo they averaged seven units of alcohol a head. With the kudzu it was 5.5 units, 20 per cent less. The kudzu group also felt more tipsy.</p><p>The current drink-drive limit – 80mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood – was set in 1967, based on a US study.</p><p>But a 2014 study found that if the driver had a blood alcohol level above this they were 13 times more likely to be involved in a fatal collision than if they were below that level.

He even kept his business-class plane ticket to the nuptials.</p><p>Thomas Markle admits to ‘stupid mistakes’, including posing for paparazzi pictures before the Royal Wedding, but says that being frozen out by Meghan and Harry ‘is a punishment which does not fit the crime’. He has apologised repeatedly for the pictures, which included one of him being measured for a wedding suit.</p><p>‘I was a fool. I was convinced to do these pictures to change my image. I was sick of seeing schlubby pictures of me buying beer which wasn’t even for me,’ he says.</p><p>‘I apologised to Harry on the phone and all he said was, “If you’d listened to me, none of this would have happened.” I did a few things wrong, said a few things I should not have said. But some of the Royals have done far worse things… There are convicts in prisons who have murdered and committed all kinds of horrible crimes, and their daughters still visit them.’</p><p>THE LIE: Meghan and her father were never that close.</p><p>FACT: Mr Markle has ‘hundreds’ of notes and cards from Meghan, who lived solely with him from the age of 11 until she went to university: ‘People are trying to rewrite history. Meghan and I were as close as a father and daughter could be right up until her wedding to Harry. Then it all fell apart.’</p><p>THE LIE: Mr Markle ‘sold out’ his daughter and has been quoted giving his opinion on recent negative stories about her, including that she brought Kate to tears in a row over the bridesmaid outfit for Princess Charlotte at Meghan’s wedding.</p><p>FACT: ‘I’m not selling stories. People make things up and my daughter and her husband believe the lies, the one thing they told me never to do. They think I’m giving hundreds of interviews. That’s rubbish. I am not perfect, I made mistakes but my punishment does not fit the crime. Even murderers get visits from their daughters in jail.’</p><p>Sitting in a hotel room close to his home in Rosarito, a beach town just across the US-Mexico border, Mr Markle said he has repeatedly reached out to Meghan to try to heal the rift.</p><p>‘I have sent several texts. Her number hasn’t changed and they haven’t bounced back,’ he says.</p><p>‘I’ve pleaded with her to pick up the phone. I wrote her a two-page letter and sent it by certified mail via her representative in Los Angeles. I asked her why she was believing the lies. I also pointed out the Royals haven’t always been perfectly behaved. I wrote that I’ve never played pool naked, nor have I dressed up as a Nazi [a reference to Harry’s infamous pictures in Las Vegas in 2012 and the time that he wore a crude imitation of a Nazi uniform, including a swastika armband, in 2005].</p><p>‘I even hand-delivered a letter to Doria asking her why our daughter won’t speak to me.</p><p>‘Everything has been met with a stony silence. Their silence means people continue to attack me and write lies about me.’</p><p>Mr Markle says he has been surprised by a spate of recent negative stories about his daughter that portray her as a petulant diva.</p><p>One claimed she reduced a staff member to tears with her 5am demands and another said she wanted to spray air freshener around ‘musty’ St George’s Chapel – a request rejected by the Queen.</p><p>Perhaps the most damaging claim concerns an alleged rift between Meghan and Kate, who is said to have been ‘reduced to tears’ by Meghan’s demands over Princess Charlotte’s bridesmaid gown and who later, allegedly, reprimanded Meghan for ‘berating’ a member of her staff.</p><p>Kate is said to have told Meghan: ‘That’s unacceptable. They’re my staff and I speak to them.’</p><p>Meghan’s father says he is baffled by the reports. ‘I don’t recognise this person,’ he says, shaking his head. ‘The Meghan I know was always sweet, kind, generous. She was always demanding but never rude. I don’t want to say or do anything to hurt my daughter but I worry she is going to hurt herself.’</p><p>Mr Markle, a retired Emmy award-winning Hollywood lighting director, adds: ‘Meghan grew up on set. I taught her to have respect for the crew. They can make you look good or awful. I don’t pretend to know what she’s like now.</p><p>‘She bends the rules. She’s good at that. But this acting up is new. She’s never been rude to me before. I can’t believe I’ve done anything severe enough to be treated this way by her.’ Indeed, he believes his bond with Meghan is ‘unbreakable’ – a point illustrated by two cards from his treasured collection.</p><p>Meghan trained as a calligrapher and wrote wedding invitations to help support herself through the early days of her acting career, a skill highlighted in her cards to her father, which are written in elegant cursive script.</p><p>‘I loved getting cards from Meghan,’ Mr Markle says. ‘She wrote me hundreds of little cards and notes through the years. Sometimes they were for special occasions, other times just little notes she would leave around the house. I’ve still got a Post-It Note on my fridge which says, “I love you Daddy.” I see it every day. I got a card every Valentine’s Day.’ He pulls one Valentine’s card from a manila folder. It shows a picture of a chubby baby holding a daffodil with a touching message: ‘Daddy… I don’t express as often as I should how much you mean to me. Everything you do for me has turned me into who I am and I am so grateful. All I want to do is make you proud… and I promise, no matter what, I’ll do it. Thank you for everything daddy. I love you with all of my heart now and forever. Love Bean’ – a reference to his childhood nickname for her.</p><p>Over the years, Mr Markle ‘willingly’ spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on his daughter, sending her to private school and even cashing in Facebook shares to help pay for her first wedding.</p><p>A Christmas card showing a llama and the words ‘Fa-La-La Llama’ arrived at Mr Markle’s Mexican home just a couple of years ago, by which time Meghan was a successful actress, earning $50,000 (£40,000) an episode on the hit TV show Suits. The card contained $2,000 for him to put towards a holiday. She wrote: ‘Daddy, Because you have always been so generous with me and taken the best care of me it brings me so much joy to be able to give you this this Christmas. I love you to no end. Meg.’</p><p>For Mr Markle, the prospect of never speaking to his daughter again is unbearable: ‘I’m hurt by what’s happened but I’m not going to stay silent.</p><p>‘My life has been turned upside down since my daughter met Harry. When they announced her pregnancy I had seven paparazzi on my doorstep night and day for seven days. They rented the house next door.</p><p>‘Their treatment of me is harsh, hurtful and unforgiving. I’m being punished for things I didn’t say.</p><p>‘I’m trolled on the internet by one guy who sits in his mother’s basement spewing lies about me. Twitter is the worst but I can’t avoid it.</p><p>‘I don’t read things but then people send them to me anyway. They say I faked my heart attacks, that I wasn’t at the first wedding. It’s all bull****. Meghan and I never had any problems before this.</p><p>‘If she would just speak to me, things could be different. I love Meghan very much. I want her and Harry to have a beautiful, healthy baby and a great life.</p><p>‘But I want them to stop believing the lies.’</p><p>Does he believe he and Meghan will ever be reunited?</p><p>He shrugs. ‘Maybe. Some day.’</p><p>''I was so proud and overcome with emotion to see my baby in a white gown'': Thomas Markle unveils touching photograph that proves he DID go to his daughter''s first wedding but said no to the party bag marijuana </p><p>He was reduced to what he calls ‘a footnote in history’ when two heart attacks prevented him from walking his daughter Meghan down the aisle of St George’s Chapel amid the pomp and pageantry of the Royal Wedding in May.</p><p>But Thomas Markle did take a starring role at Meghan’s very different first wedding to Hollywood producer Trevor Engelson in 2011, which took place under swaying palm trees on a Jamaican beach, complete with a Caribbean steel drum band and a most unusual welcome gift for the guests.</p><p>Mr Markle says he is ‘sick and tired’ of reading erroneous reports that he failed to attend the wedding, which sadly ended in divorce for the couple two years later. He explains that he asked the photographer to ignore him and concentrate on the young people showing off their beautiful bodies in swimwear.</p><p>‘There are no pictures out there of me at the wedding because it was on the beach and everyone else was in their 30s and I was in my 60s’, Mr Markle said last night, before showing The Mail on Sunday a photograph – published here for the first time. It shows him posing proudly with Meghan just moments before he and his ex-wife Doria walked her across the sand to marry Trevor.</p><p>Mr Markle also kept his business-class ticket to the four-day affair, along with an invitation, which featured a picture of a bikini-wearing Meghan on the beach entwined in Trevor’s arms, and a chilled bottle of Red Stripe beer within arm’s reach.</p><p>The wedding took place at the famous Jamaica Inn, where Meghan booked all 55 rooms and villas, taking the £1,200-a-night largest villa for herself and her new husband.</p><p>‘Meghan planned everything down to the tiniest detail. She took control of everything. I was given a white shirt to wear, as were all the male guests. She micro-managed everything,’ says Mr Markle.</p><p>‘The picture was taken when I walked into her bungalow just moments before the ceremony was due to start. I was so proud and overcome with emotion to see my baby in a white gown, looking so beautiful. We took the picture and then Doria and I both walked her down the aisle.</p><p>‘Trevor is Jewish and his father, who is a rabbi, conducted the service. But it was not a traditional Jewish ceremony. Meghan read vows she’d written herself.’</p><p>There were 100 guests – including the cast of Suits, the TV show in which Meghan starred – for the ceremony on September 10, 2011. In the US, where the month is written first, that results in 9/10/11, a date Meghan chose because it would be easy for Trevor to remember. The guests were welcomed with a gift of a small fabric bag containing a welcome note from Meghan and Trevor along with a small plastic ‘baggy’ of marijuana. Mr Markle says: ‘It’s illegal, but it’s no big deal in Jamaica. It’s almost customary down there. I don’t smoke weed and to the best of my knowledge nor does Meghan. I don’t know what I did with mine. I think I gave it away. I kept the bag and I use it to keep the sea air [at his Mexican beachside home] off one of my Emmys.’ He has won three of the awards, known as the TV Oscars.</p><p>Festivities included ‘beach yoga with Doria’ – while she is now well known, she was listed simply as ‘Meg’s mum’ on the invitation.</p><p>The Jamaica Inn is famous as the honeymoon designation of Hollywood star Marilyn Monroe and her third husband, playwright Arthur Miller, and was a regular haunt of James Bond author Ian Fleming. ‘If it’s good enough for Marilyn Monroe and Arthur Miller… it’s good enough for us,’ read the invitation.</p><p>On the day before the ‘beach chic’ wedding, the couple hosted ‘beach Olympics’ featuring the bride’s team versus the groom’s team in events such as tug-of-war and kayaking, followed by a barbecue. That night everyone danced to a reggae band.</p><p>Mr Markle, who helped pay for the celebration, is mentioned twice in the wedding literature. He is credited with ‘generously hosting’ brunch on the final day and gets a special ‘thank you’ for his ‘incredible generosity’.</p><p>Guests who chose not to stay at the Jamaica Inn were offered alternative accommodation nearby at The Royal Plantation.</p><p>The wedding invitation reads: ‘Cheers to love, cheers to laughter, cheers to happily ever after.’ Two years later, the marriage was over.</p><p>Thomas Markle neither asked for nor received payment for this interview.</p><p>Thomas Markle produced piles of medical bills that ‘prove conclusively’ he had not one, but two heart attacks before the wedding of Meghan and Harry.</p><p>Mr Markle had the first heart attack the weekend before the ceremony and has documents proving he was in hospital in Mexico for a day and a half. He then felt well enough to drive to Los Angeles to deliver flowers to his ex-wife Doria before being taken ill again when he returned home to Rosarito. </p><p>‘The doctors told me I was having a second heart attack,’ he says. ‘I had a blocked artery which they call the widow maker. A friend took me across the border to a US hospital and they saved my life.’</p><p>Bills totalling more than a £100,000 show he was discharged from Sharp Chula Vista Medical Center in California on May 17.</p><p>Prince Harry called when Mr Markle was recovering in hospital and said: ‘If you’d listened to me none of this would have happened’ – referring to the media stories about the faked paparazzi pictures. Mr Markle hung up on Harry but says he regrets this because it started the rift.</p><p>BY TINA WEAVER   </p><p>Like a wounded bear, Thomas Markle lurches between pain and anger. His only balm the tender words he reads over and over again. The familiar voice of his beloved daughter calling out from between the lines of her immaculate handwritten script.</p><p>‘Daddy, I don’t express as often as I should how much you mean to me,’ writes Meghan. ‘Everything you do for me has turned me into who I am and I am so grateful.’</p><p>In one of the last notes she sent, just months before she met Prince Harry, Meghan signed off: ‘I love you with all of my heart now and forever. Love Bean’ – her childhood nickname.</p><p>Each heartfelt word reveals the true sentiments of a devoted daughter. Meghan’s love for Thomas Markle is as plain as day.</p><p>Yet today he is a pariah. At 74, in failing health in his twilight years, he is spending Christmas ostracised by his daughter. Heartbroken, cut off and cast out into the cold by an angry and indignant Meghan.</p><p>The irony will be lost on the new Duchess of Sussex, as she fine-tunes her favoured philanthropic causes, that charity, as the saying goes, should begin at home. But to her, Thomas has become an embarrassment and a rolling public humiliation.</p><p>Unable to manage and control him, she has pulled up the drawbridge. Behind the castle walls she will not – cannot – be reached. While Thomas feels wounded, Meghan feels betrayed. She is unwilling to climb down from the battlements. Meghan’s Royal ambition is leaving a large and untidy wake.</p><p>She has in the past been accused of using people and then quickly moving on up the ladder, never looking back.</p><p>It may be harsh to say she’s ‘ghosting’ her father – the fashionable term used when someone cuts off all communication without warning or explanation. Thomas prefers to describe her behaviour as ‘acting up’. But what’s certain is that she has approached her new Royal life at full tilt, head down, powering through.</p><p>As Thomas says: ‘She was a control freak but never in a bad way – she was always sweet and kind.’</p><p>Meghan’s marriage to Prince Harry wasn’t simply falling in love – although that was the main impetus – it was a life transformation of unimaginable proportions.</p><p>A girl raised in a series of Los Angeles apartment blocks, who reinvented herself as a successful TV actress, is now reinventing herself as a princess.</p><p>Since joining the House of Windsor her personal style has got more regal and refined. She has made sure social issues are front and centre of her public persona, like her high-profile cookbook launch to help Grenfell survivors with mum Doria in tow. And, of course, she plays the Royal wife with aplomb, as we have seen on the couple’s dazzling tour to Australia and New Zealand. She is, as one source says, ‘putting everything into this’. And as Thomas observes, his perfectionist daughter has always liked to micro-manage her life.</p><p>Meghan knew her arrival in the Royal circle would be tricky. A divorcee, a woman with history, there was always the chance of a disgruntled ex speaking out.</p><p>What no one expected – and what has repeatedly wrong-footed Palace officials – is that it would be her immediate family who would prove to be the headache.</p><p>While Doria has been the personification of discretion, Meghan views her father’s meandering outbursts during this critical time as a reminder of where she came from – not where she’s going. And right now, she finds it unforgivable. A post she shared on her old lifestyle blog The Tig gives a telling insight into how she deals with such ‘negative experiences’.</p><p>She quoted Portuguese life coach José Micard Teixeira, who wrote: ‘I no longer have patience for certain things, not because I’ve become arrogant, but simply because I reached a point in my life where I do not want to waste more time with what displeases me or hurts me. I lost the will to please those who do not like me, to love those who do not love me and to smile at those who do not want to smile at me.’</p><p>This philosophy still drives Meghan’s thinking and has been firmly applied to her father’s behaviour.</p><p>From day one she has appeared to play favourites with her parents – Doria got an official Palace scroll announcing their wedding, Thomas didn’t. Doria was formally invited to the nuptials, Thomas wasn’t. And he was very hurt when told he couldn’t make a speech at the reception.</p><p>In most family feuds, it takes a third party – a husband or partner – to intervene, break the entrenched positions and tactfully suggest the offer of an olive branch might be the best way forward.</p><p>Harry should have been that peacemaker. But headstrong, unworldly and in thrall to his starry, beautiful wife he did nothing to calm the brewing storm.</p><p>Rather than respectfully meeting his father-in-law face to face before the couple’s engagement was announced, he chose a quick chat on the phone. Harry – or rather his advisers – had the chance to bring Thomas into the Royal tent before the world even knew Meghan and Harry were a couple. It was a dropped ball that has led us to this point.</p><p>When, only days before the wedding, Thomas foolishly agreed to stunt some photographs, Harry was on the phone again, this time to severely berate him. Thomas, recovering from urgent heart surgery and deeply embarrassed by his actions, pulled out of his daughter’s big day. Some Royal insiders suggested he faked the surgery to find an excuse, but, as we reveal today, it actually saved his life.</p><p>For Meghan, the joy of her Windsor Castle wedding shared by the world was a chance to put all the unpleasantness behind her. She decided to take a ‘time out’ from her Dad, but neglected to communicate that to him properly. Once again, he felt hurt and slighted and reacted angrily in a live TV interview.</p><p>Right now it’s hard to see Meghan giving ground. Just in practical terms she is heavily pregnant, working with interior designers and armed with swatch fabric and paint samples, to redevelop the couple’s new home, Frogmore Cottage, in time for the spring birth. She won’t be jumping on a plane to Mexico to make peace with her father in those circumstances. But with Thomas in ailing health, Harry needs to man up and fix what he inadvertently set off in the first place by failing to show Meghan’s father the necessary respect. Only then will Meghan and her father be reunited.</p><p>Time is a great healer – but time is also something that we can never have enough of. Harry and Prince William spoke movingly last year of how they are haunted by their last hurried phone call to their mother, Princess Diana, the evening before she died.</p><p>They were eager to get off the phone because they were having such a great time playing with their cousins at Balmoral. Harry said in an interview: ‘I can’t really necessarily remember what I said but all I do remember is probably regretting for the rest of my life how short the phone call was.’</p><p>It’s a sentiment we have all felt in one way or another. A visit we never made, a call not returned, and suddenly the chance to say what we wanted to say is gone for ever.</p><p>Meghan is at heart a good and generous woman who is ambitious and could be critical in the reinvention of the Royal Family for another generation.</p><p>But what she cannot be is forever cast as the cruelly unforgiving daughter of a heartbroken and lonely old man.</p><p>And Harry holds the key to making sure that doesn’t happen – before it’s too late.</p>', 'https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6475167/Meghans-father-Thomas-Markle-reveals-sweet-cards-proof-did-wedding.html');

It was the start of a career that led her to become one of the country’s most successful female fund managers. </p><p>These days, she does not manage money but is head of personal investing at Legal & General Investment Management. Her overwhelming mission is to prod the nation – particularly women – into investing. </p><p>As a celebration of her milestone, 52-year-old Morrissey has requested a ‘proper briefcase’ for Christmas. She says: ‘Recently I have been carrying around a bulging Planet Organic bag full of papers. I have decided to try to start a new trend of old fashioned briefcases. It is my “Working Girl” moment.’</p><p>This is a nod to the McGill character who transformed into executive mode whenever she picked up her sturdy leather briefcase.</p><p>Morrissey hardly needs transforming after a lucrative career both for her and her main former employer, fund manager Newton. She was its chief executive, taking assets under management from £20 billion to £50 billion.</p><p>Her journey to the top of the fund management tree may not have started from working class beginnings but it was relatively modest – her parents were both teachers, she went to a comprehensive school and holidays were spent at an aunt’s cottage.</p><p>But hard work and a philosophy degree from Cambridge University gave her the momentum she required. A stay-at-home husband Richard – taking care of their nine children, now aged nine to 27 – has also allowed her to pursue a high-octane career.</p><p>She recognises her good fortune as a woman making it in a pinstriped man’s world and has been busy encouraging more gender balance in the boardroom. She started the 30% Club five years ago – a campaign to ensure the boards of FTSE 100 companies comprise at least 30 per cent women. Back then the ratio was 12.5 per cent. It achieved its target for the first time a couple of months ago.</p><p>From helping working girls get on in their careers she is now turning her attention to doing the same for ‘investing girls’. Her quest is to encourage more women to put money aside for their future.</p><p>It is an almighty challenge, given that many women, especially mothers, neglect saving of any sort – never mind delve into the dark arts of the stock market.</p><p>WOMEN ARE FAILING TO SAVE</p><p>A JOINT survey conducted by L&G and parents network Mumsnet published today reveals that one in four mums actively put off planning for their financial future – while a similar proportion say they do not want to invest. All rather dangerous considering so many relationships now end up hitting the rocks.</p><p>The most alarming statistic, says Morrissey, is that three in five women fail to save for more than five years in the future – putting both their own and children’s prosperity at risk. The survey found just seven per cent of women have money in a tax-efficient stocks and shares Individual Savings Account. Even fewer (five per cent) have taken out a Junior Isa for their children.</p><p>The nub, says Morrissey, is that often women simply ‘don’t have the money’. The struggle starts as soon as women embark upon their careers and suffer from the gender pay gap. This cascades into a gender investment gap and finally a gender pensions gap.</p><p>Morrissey adds: ‘There are some shocking figures from Insuring Women’s Futures, a campaign by the Chartered Insurance Institute. It shows that by retirement, married women have an average pension pot of £35,000. That is the size of the pot, not the annual income it will produce. This is one fifth the size of a male’s average pension pot.’</p><p>While recent Government figures show some six million women have Isas, just 900,000 have directed their contributions into the stock market. The rest have put them in cash – condemning the money to shrink in real terms over time.</p><p>Morrissey says: ‘People have an emotional relationship with money. But we need to talk more about money even if it’s not that cool a subject.’</p><p>Making investment material more friendly would help. Morrissey has an artwork in her office that represents the holdings of an index tracker investment fund. The pictogram shows the logos of brands belonging to companies held in the fund – from Apple computers to Marlboro cigarettes – with their size dependent on the percentage that each represents in the index fund.</p><p>When first put on display, Morrissey says it got people talking about what investments they would rather not invest in such as oil and tobacco.</p><p>Passing on good financial habits to children is also key. Morrissey’s father taught her, aged four, to count using pounds, shillings and pence. She adds: ‘I was frustrated not long afterwards when Britain converted to decimalisation and I had to learn a new system.’ She has ensured her nine children keep on top of money issues. Her youngest daughter, for example, knows the cost of ingredients for her latest hobby – making toy ‘slime’.</p><p>Morrissey has enough money these days not to worry about household bills, but it was not always so. She says: ‘It took me a long time to enjoy financial comfort, especially with all the childcare costs.’</p><p>Her first investment was in property, a flat purchased in 1988 just as the housing market peaked in advance of a colossal crash. It left many homeowners, including Morrissey, in negative equity. To add to the pain, mortgage rates shot up to 15 per cent. ‘In hindsight this proved a big motivator,’ she says. ‘It made me hungry to make money.’</p><p>A bit of serendipity helped improve her financial fortunes. She says. ‘I was sent to New York soon after joining Schroders. But because I was being paid in pounds the exchange rate worked in my favour. I managed to save that extra.’</p><p>Morrissey recognises that many young mums have other issues on their mind than saving for the future. But she wants to convey the message that investing little and often is the best strategy for building wealth.</p><p>She compares the approach to getting fit. She says: ‘I want to make women think about investing in the same way as they do about keeping fit and healthy. Doing regular steps, attending classes, making it part of the everyday routine.’</p><p>INVEST LITTLE AND OFTEN</p><p>SMALL beginnings might mean putting aside just £20 on a regular basis. She says: ‘If there is volatility in stock markets then do not worry as that can be an opportunity to invest for less.’</p><p>Just one in 10 fund managers are women. But when she looked a couple of years ago at who were the managers behind ‘environmental, social and governance’ funds – investments that buy shares in companies looking to make the world a better place – nearly two thirds were female. Unsurprisingly, this type of fund is also popular with women investors.</p><p>With this in mind, she masterminded the launch earlier this year of L&G’s Future World Gender in Leadership fund –dubbed the ‘Girl’ fund. It invests in those firms with good diversity profiles and aims to ‘empower investors to make a difference to the companies in which they invest and wider society’.</p><p>Experts such as Jason Hollands at broker Tilney believe there is a role for such an investment strategy. He adds: ‘This is a fund for those who want their money to have an influence.’</p><p>L&G also embraces younger females by sponsoring a new ‘saver badge’ with Girlguiding, the life skills organisation. She says: ‘The badge is about teaching girls about saving time, money and resources.’</p><p>Ultimately, she wants organising financial matters to slip neatly into women’s everyday life. She says: ‘It would be great if we could end up with everyone setting aside a couple of hours once a quarter to focus on finance. It would give women a sense of achievement and make them less worried about money.’</p><p>There is still a long way to go before the wealth gap between men and women is plugged. But as Morrissey unwraps her briefcase on Christmas Day she will be sending a powerful message. This working girl still means business.</p><p>UNCERTAINTY over Brexit abounds, but it is of little concern to fund manager Alex Wright of investment house Fidelity. No sleepless nights yet for the manager who six years ago stepped into the investment shoes of the legendary Anthony Bolton.</p><p>Although Wright runs two investment funds predominantly invested in the UK stock market, he remains remarkably relaxed over whether Theresa May will lose the Commons vote on her Brexit deal on Tuesday. Or for that matter about whether the country ends up doing no deal or agreeing revised terms.</p><p>As far as Wright is concerned, the UK stock market as a whole is ‘cheap’ and provides him with some outstanding opportunities to buy good companies at competitive prices. Businesses that will stand the funds and their investors in good stead over the coming months and years. ‘There is a lot of irrationality out there,’ he says. ‘Many institutional investors are ignoring the UK stock market because of the Brexit factor, but in so doing they are ignoring value that cannot be obtained elsewhere.’</p><p>As a fund manager, he says he is the most excited since 2011 when the Eurozone was hit by a sovereign debt crisis that swept across Portugal, Spain, Greece, Italy and Spain. During periods of such uncertainty, Wright thrives, picking up good companies at attractive prices that he can make a profit on, either short or long term.</p><p>The two funds he manages, Fidelity Special Values Investment Trust and Fidelity Special Situations, are set up on similar lines, holding some 100 common stocks. The only difference is that Special Values has greater borrowing powers which Wright has used to build a mini sub-portfolio of 20 micro stocks. Currently, the two funds have 35 per cent of their UK stock market exposure invested in ‘UK facing stocks’ – companies that derive most of their earnings domestically. The remaining 65 per cent comprises businesses that are more international in outlook.</p><p>Wright’s contention is that if May does not get her way on Tuesday and a Brexit deal cannot be agreed, sterling is likely to fall, benefiting companies with big overseas earnings.</p><p>But if an agreement is reached before next March, the stock market is likely to react positively, impacting favourably on all listed companies but in particular on many domestic-focused companies whose shares have been deflated the most by Brexit nerves. The likes of insurers Aviva and Phoenix – and banks Lloyds and Royal Bank of Scotland. All are key holdings in both funds and earn most of their revenues in the UK.</p><p>Wright has proved a successful heir to Bolton. Over the past five years, Special Values has delivered a total return of more than 45 per cent, comfortably in excess of the UK stock market. Even over the past year when the FTSE All-Share has slipped back, the trust’s shares have just about held their head above water. Special Situations has also outperformed the index since Wright took over in early 2014.</p><p>Wright’s approach is contrarian, buying unloved stocks and then hoping for them to become loved again. The best ever contributor to the Special Values’ performance was games maker Electronic Arts that he sold last year after a 500 per cent share price gain.</p><p>Fidelity Special Values and Special Situations represent solid long-term investments for investors. Good building blocks for exposure to the UK stock market.</p><p>By Jeff Prestridge </p>', 'https://www.dailymail.co.uk/money/article-6474651/The-mother-NINE-ran-50billion-fund-mission-help-women-charge-money.html');

''Everyone wants theirs to look professionally decorated so it looks good on social media. </p><p>Seeing other people''s trees – particularly those of celebrities – has raised everyone''s game.</p><p>''Having more than one tree is very popular now and people often have one they let their children decorate which they''ll hide in a bedroom, while their big show tree will be beautifully styled and displayed in the hall or living room.''</p><p>For Laura, ensuring her tree looks as good as that owned by any celebrity is a cherished part of her Christmas preparations, which begin when most of us are still enjoying the final throes of summer. </p><p>''September is when the Christmas collection hits the John Lewis website, and I''m on it straight away to see what the new themes are so I can buy more decorations,'' says the mother- of-two from Stockport.</p><p>Each decoration Laura owns has a special meaning to her or her daughters, Scarlett, eight, and Sienna, five.</p><p>''I spend more than £15 each on many of them, but I love them all because they have a story,'' she says. </p><p>''Every year I buy the girls handmade ones from craft fairs with their names and the date on. They like pretty, girly designs so we have unicorns, mermaids and fairies, and baubles which are beaded or iridescent.</p><p>''I like glass and wooden ones, which is why they''re expensive, and I''m always buying more. I''ve just found an astronaut one which I was excited about, because that''s what I wanted to be as a child.''</p><p>According to Keri, Laura''s passion for unique decorations is one of the year''s biggest trends. ''I''ve seen so many unusual designs – squids, cacti, unicorns,'' she says.</p><p>''Personalisation is very popular, as are heirloom pieces, which cost a lot and are intended to be investments to keep for a long time.''</p><p>Among the most sought-after designs are those by Gisela Graham, whose delicately intricate fairy and ballerina ornaments cost up to £100. </p><p>''Decorations are becoming like items of jewellery to hang on the tree,'' says Keri. ''I am seeing more and more bling.''</p><p>Laura''s Christmas mania stems from her childhood, when her mother waited until two weeks before the big day to put up the family tree.</p><p>''I''d be desperate to do it earlier and she''d say, ''When you have your own house, you can do it as soon as you like.'' </p><p>Now she jokes, ''You really followed through on that, didn''t you?'' ''</p><p>She festoons the rest of her home with snow globes and Santa cushions. So extensive is her collection of decorations that it took Laura and her mother two hours to get them all out of the attic. </p><p>''The boxes filled the living room,'' she laughs.</p><p>''I do it all while the girls are out and tell them elves decorated it. It makes me so happy to make everything look magical for them. </p><p>''And the tree is the most important part – it''s my pride and joy.''</p><p>While putting up the tree has become a much-loved festive ritual for people like Laura, the ultimate Christmas indulgence has to be hiring somebody to decorate your tree for you, allowing you to sit back and watch while your home becomes a winter wonderland.</p><p>For style specialists, business is booming. Anya Banks runs a premium Christmas decoration company and says that she''s never been in greater demand.</p><p>''This year it''s been absolutely crazy,'' she says. ''It''s been extremely busy, and I''ve noticed it started earlier than usual, too.''</p><p>Among the homes Anya has already transformed is that of Sonya Latham and her husband Paul. </p><p>The retired couple, who have two children and three grandchildren, now have three stunning trees at their home near Market Harborough in Leicestershire. </p><p>In their entrance hall stands an 11ft beauty adorned with red and gold baubles, bows and golden twigs. </p><p>The living room boasts a 9ft tree bedecked with gold, silver and white ornaments and cinnamon sticks. In a second reception room is another 9ft tree, this time decorated in gold, purple and ivy.</p><p>''It''s an indulgence, but it''s so lovely,'' says Sonya, 61.</p><p>''The trees look so special and they''re perfect – if I tried for a fortnight I could never make them look so nice.''</p><p>All the trees are artificial, but Sonya sprays them with pine scent to ''get the best of both worlds''. She and Paul also own countless baubles, bows and lights.</p><p>''When we met Anya, she came to our house to talk about what we wanted and see the colour scheme of the rooms,'' says Sonya. </p><p>''She sourced the baubles and garlands for us initially, and every year she replenishes anything that''s looking a bit tired. </p><p>She looks out for things I''ll like, such as the gold pear ornaments she found this year.''</p><p>For £2,000, Anya and her team of five arrived at 9am on November 29 and spent more than six hours assembling and dressing the trees. </p><p>They also decorated other parts of Sonya''s home, including her orangery, in which they hung twigs and twinkly lights.</p><p>On January 4, while the rest of us are lugging our threadbare firs to the local recycling point, Anya''s team will reappear to take everything down again, leaving it all packed away neatly in boxes and her home looking spotless.</p><p>For Sonya and Paul, the cost is worth it for the pleasure the immaculately decorated trees will bring them over the coming weeks.</p><p>''We love Christmas and the whole family are celebrating it at our house, so we want everything to look as inviting as possible,'' says Sonya. </p><p>''It''s Paul''s birthday just before Christmas, so we''ll be celebrating that, too – the decorations will be seen by plenty of people. Our trees make us happy so why not celebrate properly if we can?''</p><p>But it''s not just extravagant decorations or multiple trees that are costing well into the thousands. </p><p>Even minimally decorated trees come with huge price tags, as Jaclyn Ford and her partner Steve Johnson found when they splashed out £1,600 on an artificial tree for their Cheshire home.</p><p>Steve, 56, and Jaclyn, 40, have put the 8ft tree which has 4,750 lights, in pride of place in their living room. </p><p>''It''s a lot of money, but we see it as an investment,'' says Jaclyn, who works for Steve''s electricity pylon company.</p><p>''The lights go all the way from the middle to the tips of the branches and there are no wires, which are my pet hate. </p><p>It''s the first year we''ve bought an artificial tree but it looks very realistic.''</p><p>The couple''s expensive taste extends to the minimalist ornaments, too. ''All the baubles are silver and glass, which reflect the lights – it''s tasteful, with a simple wicker skirt at the bottom from the White Company,'' she says.</p><p>''I spent more than £400 on the decorations, which are from Marks & Spencer. Obviously, with such a big tree it needed a lot to cover it.''</p><p>Steve''s children are grown up, but they will be hosting friends and family for parties throughout the Christmas period, so they view the investment as worthwhile.</p><p>Some will see this level of extravagance for a season which is over all too quickly as festive madness.</p><p>But Jaclyn says: ''We love Christmas and it''s great to have something everyone can enjoy when they come over. We''re proud of our house so we wanted a tree we could be proud of too.''</p><p> </p>', 'https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6475267/Meet-woman-pays-team-FIVE-2-000-decorate-three-Christmas-trees.html');

A group of Cabinet ministers have been mulling it over as a fallback plan.</p><p>It would effectively keep the UK in the single market, with a customs bolt-on to avoid a hard Irish border, and backers say it would keep Britain close to the EU while cutting contributions to Brussels.</p><p>However, critics say it has the drawbacks of keeping free movement, - and tightly limiting the possibilities for doing trade deals elsewhere.</p><p>The EU is also thought to have concerns about a country the UK''s size joining the EEA, while other states in the group might be resistant.</p><p>If the Norway model was endorsed by the Commons, it would not be binding on the government.</p><p>But it would have huge political force, and it might be very difficult for ministers to face down the calls.</p><p>Mrs May is unlikely to be able to put the policy in place as it break her often-stated red lines.</p><p>In the end, it might need a new government of national unity, perhaps led by a respected cross-party figure, to put the UK on course for Norway-plus - with the prospect of a general election soon afterwards.</p><p> </p><p> </p>', 'https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6476411/Cabinet-ministers-talks-Labour-MPs-holding-Brexit-referendum.html');

And more importantly, where does this all leave patients?</p><p>Mary Huckle, 53, a personal trainer and mother- of-three from Enfield, North London, was diagnosed in August 2007 with an aggressive form of breast cancer.</p><p>She says: ‘I have small breasts and the lump was found behind my nipple, so I had no choice but to have a mastectomy.</p><p>‘After six months of chemo, I started taking tamoxifen in 2008. I was on it for five years. My decision to come off it was made when it was suggested it would be even better to take it for ten years.</p><p>‘The side effects were unbearable. I woke up every morning with a foggy head and awful headache.</p><p>‘There was joint pain in the wrist and knees. Then I started getting back pain too.</p><p>‘I used to be a Pilates teacher – I know how to look after my body and this wasn’t normal for me.</p><p>‘When I stopped taking the drug, the headaches and brain fog went immediately.</p><p>‘As the drug was still in my system, it took a while for the joint pain to go. I’ve got secondary cancer now and take an oral chemo drug and a hormone inhibitor – but not tamoxifen.</p><p>‘The second cancer was diagnosed around the same time I stopped tamoxifen.</p><p>‘My oncologist supported me in that decision and said it was a coincidence. Although the drug reduces the risk of recurrence, it doesn’t eliminate it.</p><p>‘Even today, I have no regrets about stopping it.</p><p>‘I understand why so many women come off it. My quality of life is so much better. As soon as I ditched tamoxifen, I got “me” back.’</p><p>Tamoxifen, which blocks the activity of the female sex hormone oestrogen in the body, started life in 1962 as a contraceptive pill.</p><p>Then, in the 1980s, trials showed that when given to breast cancer patients after surgery and other treatments such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy, it further reduced the risk of the disease coming back. By stopping oestrogen from reaching the cancer cells, it meant tumours grew more slowly or ceased growing altogether.</p><p>Today, it is one of the most taken drugs to treat the disease, and is recommended by prescribing watchdog the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence for about 80 per cent of breast cancer patients.</p><p>And, after further studies found that it reduced the chances of breast cancer developing in the first place, in 2013 it became the first drug to be prescribed to prevent cancer.</p><p>It is estimated that up to 500,000 women could benefit, but online forums are awash with breast cancer survivors who are struggling against the side effects.</p><p>Many talk about how they stopped taking tamoxifen for a ‘holiday’ and their symptoms melted away. They also complain about how doctors often trivialise or dismiss symptoms experienced by women on tamoxifen.</p><p>One woman, on Breast Cancer Care’s forum, writes: ‘I have been taking tamoxifen for about six months. I am restless, anxious, moody and the hot flushes are unbearable.</p><p>‘I’m just not sure that I am gonna be able to conquer this but am so worried about stopping the treatment. I am so miserable.’</p><p>Another, on the Cancer Research UK forum, states: ‘I have hot flushes, but compared to the joint pain, coping with those is a walk in the park.’</p><p>However, there are more reassuring comments: ‘For the first few months the sweating was horrendous, but I had my dose adjusted as I found I could handle 10mg twice a day but not 20mg once a day.’</p><p>Karen Bates, 55, was prescribed tamoxifen in 2015, after being diagnosed with cancer in her left breast. The author, from Lincolnshire, who had surgery to remove her breast along with chemotherapy and other drugs, said: ‘It made me feel like I was 90. I ached everywhere – it was as though I had arthritis.</p><p>‘I was worn out, tired, snappy. My libido had gone too.</p><p>‘A year after starting it, I stopped taking it for a month. I was about to have my breast reconstructed and tamoxifen is a blood thinner.</p><p>‘I got “me” back during that time, so I discussed tamoxifen with my oncologist, who told me that taking it meant I had only a two per cent chance of the cancer returning.</p><p>‘So I decided not to take it any more. He wasn’t happy but understood my reasoning. The cancer might come back – who knows?’</p><p>So is tamoxifen always to blame for such terrible symptoms?</p><p>Last year, Cuzick and his team at Queen Mary University published the latest in a number of studies that suggest not. For five years, they followed thousands of healthy women taking tamoxifen for cancer prevention. Half were given the real drug daily and the other half a placebo or dummy pill, containing no active drug.</p><p>They found that just as many women – about a third – taking the dummy treatment suffered severe side effects and dropped out of the trial, as those on the real thing.</p><p>‘This would suggest it’s not the tamoxifen causing the problems. It’s only natural when we have aches and pains to blame it on something,’ explains Cuzick.</p><p>‘But the truth is, these things are just part of life as we get older.’</p><p>Try telling that to Liz O’Riordan, consultant breast surgeon at Ipswich Hospital NHS Trust, who has twice had breast cancer herself, and you’ll be cut a short shrift.</p><p>She says: ‘I hated taking it. It’s a horrible drug. If there was anything else, I would have stopped it, but there isn’t. It’s the best we have at the moment.’</p><p>O’Riordan, 43, who has written a bestselling book, The Complete Guide To Breast Cancer, adds: ‘With normal menopause, the symptoms come on gradually.</p><p>‘But on tamoxifen, it’s “bang” – hot flushes, night sweats, insomnia, hair thinning – you can’t have sex because of vaginal dryness, and you lose your libido.</p><p>‘I know women who have begged their husbands to divorce them because they feel so bad about what they’re putting them through.’</p><p>Doughty was just as forthright. ‘Any doctor, male or female, who actually sees patients will know that women really struggle with tamoxifen. The side effects are very real.’</p><p>There is a long-standing problem with sex bias in medical research – although few doctors will say much on the subject. Dr Clare Gerada, a GP based in London and former chair of the Royal College of GPs, says: ‘There has been a cautious, even paternalistic, medical approach to women for many years. Think back to Victorian times when women were treated for hysteria when they had physical illnesses.’</p><p>Scientific studies themselves may be relying on assumptions made in the past that contained a gender bias, such as underestimating heart attack fatalities in women, because they have subtle ‘silent’ symptoms which are often missed.</p><p>It is recognised that the lack of studies of women and how they respond to medications, which may be different to men, in cardiac medicine means mortality rates from heart disease are higher in older women than in men, for instance.</p><p>Gerada says ‘The legacy of gender bias in medical research is only just beginning to be understood, but it may cause incorrect conclusions to be drawn today.’</p><p>O’Riordan believes part of the problem is that women aren’t being completely honest with their doctors. She says: ‘Women often under-report side effects, thinking they just have to put up with them. About half of women stop tamoxifen treatment early, but pretend to their doctor they are taking it because they feel so guilty.</p><p>‘And some male doctors may well think, “How bad can a few hot flushes be?” So they don’t appreciate how debilitating the side effects are. Maybe they don’t think a pill can make you feel that bad.’</p><p>And what of the idea that the symptoms aren’t really side effects at all? ‘That’s b******s,’ she says.</p><p>FOCUS ON personal ‘risk assessmentS’</p><p>So what should women, fairly concerned about the downsides of taking tamoxifen, do?</p><p>Doughty believes there needs to be a more personalised approach to prescribing.</p><p>She says: ‘I’m not telling breast cancer patients, “Stop taking medication.” But it’s so important for each woman to be given a really accurate risk of her cancer coming back based on the stage and type of cancer she has, her age and other risk factors.</p><p>‘Some women may feel that they are prepared to cope with side effects if it maximises their chances of seeing their children grow up, for example.</p><p>‘But if she is really struggling on tamoxifen, and the risk of her cancer returning is very low – say ten per cent over a ten-year period – the decision may be taken between her and her oncologist to stop it. However, if the risk is 40 per cent, she may well want to persevere.’</p><p>O’Riordan agrees. She says: ‘We have very good ways to assess individual risk, using computer scoring models. A woman who has a very small cancer that hasn’t spread may already have a 90 per cent chance of being alive a decade later after surgery and radiotherapy alone. So the benefit of tamoxifen will be small.</p><p>‘If the tumour is large, if it has spread, and the patient is having chemo, the benefit of the drug might be greater. Those patients might want to consider trying it for six months to a year, to see how they get on.’</p><p>And what about healthy women offered it for prevention?</p><p>‘You’re asking a healthy young woman to take a drug that will make them feel like s**t, that could turn them into a sexless, menopausal woman, suffering weight gain, thinning hair, leg cramps and everything else.</p><p>‘It increases the risk of cataracts, blood clots, strokes and endometrial cancer which, if you’re taking it to prevent breast cancer coming back, may be worth the risk. But even women who have had breast cancer don’t want to take it.’</p><p>Cuzick, however, feels that women should give it go. He says: ‘Some women – about 20 per cent – will have a very difficult time, and they should stop if they want to.</p><p>‘But in most cases, problems are mild. There’s also evidence that in breast cancer patients, these side effects show that the drug is working well.</p><p>‘Scare stories about side effects shouldn’t stop women at risk of breast cancer trying it, to see how they do on it. It doesn’t mean they’re committed to taking it for ever.</p><p>‘And for those who have had breast cancer and are taking it to stop it coming back, there is a case for putting up with the downsides for five years, as the benefits make it worth it.’</p><p>As for those on the drug suffering the side effects, Cuzick says: ‘Many of the aches and pains associated with getting older can be alleviated by more physical exercise. This is true whether you are taking tamoxifen or not.</p><p>‘For some women, this could mean going to the gym and doing a workout. And for others, it could be as simple as walking more.’</p>', 'https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-6474467/Are-male-doctors-complacent-cancer-pill-women-say-ruining-lives.html');

It would mean grave uncertainty for the nation with a very real risk of no Brexit or leaving the European Union with no deal.</p><p>‘We have a leader of the Opposition who thinks of nothing but attempting to bring about a General Election, no matter what the cost to the country. As someone who cares passionately about my country and my party, I believe Jeremy Corbyn getting his hands on power is a risk we cannot afford to take’.</p><p>Although multiple sources say that a growing number of senior Government figures were urging Mrs May to delay the Commons vote until after another attempt to extract further concessions from Brussels, the Prime Minister was maintaining the line that her Cabinet was united behind the idea of holding the vote this week.</p><p>‘I have obviously talked to my Cabinet colleagues as well as I talk to other colleagues. I think we all recognise that this is a good deal’, she insisted.</p><p>Mrs May is privately furious that the Brexit ‘ultras’, including Jacob Ress-Mogg and Boris Johnson, are so determined to crash her deal that they will topple a line of dominos which could lead to a vote of no confidence, the end of Mrs May’s leadership, the suspension of Article 50, a General Election ushering in a Labour-SNP Government and a second referendum to attempt to reverse Brexit. As one ally says: ‘We would go to hell in a handcart’.</p><p>But while large sections of her Parliamentary party remain unconvinced by her deal and her determination to put it to a vote, Mrs May says she has been cheered by more than 3,000 personal messages of support from ordinary voters.</p><p>‘I’ve had a lot of letters, a lot of emails, a lot of support from people,’ she says. ‘It really has been encouraging. </p><p>The overwhelming message from people is: let’s get this deal done and then we can focus on the future. People say, “look, we just wish you the best because we really want to see Brexit and we want to get on with this.”’</p><p>Mrs May – one of the most effective stonewallers in Westminster –deflects all questions about whether she will resign if she is defeated over the deal or go back to Brussels to demand more concessions.</p><p>But she is openly dismissive about moves by a cross-party group of MPs, led by Tory MP Sarah Wollaston, to call a second referendum – and withering about her predecessor Tony Blair’s call for one.</p><p>‘His view is that we should go for another referendum,’ she said. ‘We had a people’s vote, that’s what frustrates me when people talk about this, the second referendum being a people’s vote. We had a people’s vote, let’s deliver on the first people’s vote.’</p><p>The prospect of another General Election, particularly after last year’s fiasco, chills many Tory MPs, who argue that the party machine is not ready to fight a successful campaign, and that Mrs May is the wrong person to lead them into one. </p><p>She isn’t exactly enthused by the idea either: ‘There isn’t going to be a General Election. As far as I’m concerned, the next General Election is 2022. </p><p>Jeremy Corbyn is trying to engineer an Election but the last thing this country needs is the instability and uncertainty that would produce’.</p><p>Valiantly, Mrs May said she hoped the deal could be voted through by Christmas so she can enjoy that goose and ‘a nice glass of red’ chosen by Philip.</p><p>‘I think most people want us to do this, to get it done and get it all wrapped up by Christmas and actually focus on the future,’ she said.</p><p>How will she celebrate, assuming events allow it? ‘We like to have a quiet Christmas. We’ll have a couple of friends round on Christmas Day, and the churches in Maidenhead have a lunch for people who would otherwise be on their own and so I go up and have a glass of sherry with them. Then we go home and we have our dinner.’</p><p>The Mays will be sticking to their usual meal. ‘It’s always goose I’m afraid, yes. Most people always cook turkey, I always cook goose. With everything else that’s going on it’s tried and tested. I try to do a slightly different recipe every year. I saw one in a magazine the other day’.</p><p>Mrs May was delighted when former Chancellor Kenneth Clarke called her a ‘bloody difficult woman’, and she celebrates the epithet on her mug.</p><p> But will she last longer in her office than her hole punch? </p><p>Her devotion to Philip, who she married 38 years ago after meeting at Oxford, is obvious. </p><p>The tight bond between the pair was forged in extremis when her father, an Oxfordshire vicar, died in a car accident a year after the wedding. Her mother died the following year and she does not have any siblings.</p><p>Mrs May praises Philip’s Christmas present choices, saying he is particularly ‘good at handbags; he does pick a good handbag’.</p><p>What is the best present she has got him? ‘I think he would look me in the eye and say, “You, darling!” ’</p><p>Even Mrs May’s fiercest critics admire her resilience in the face of what must be almost intolerable pressure, combined with official duties such as last weekend’s 14,000-mile round-trip to the G20 summit in Argentina.</p><p>It was former Chancellor Kenneth Clarke who delighted Mrs May by describing her as ‘a bloody difficult woman’.</p><p>But surely her husband must worry about the impact of the pressure on the diabetic, 62-year-old Prime Minister. ‘He is like any supportive partner is,’ she says. ‘He’s there and wants to help.’</p><p>She adds that she never takes out the strain on her staff. ‘I am not the sort of person who naturally loses their temper,’ she says, but confesses she does swear ‘sometimes’.</p><p>Does she ever wake up with nightmares? ‘If I woke up and went “aaagh!” I’d probably have several armed police officers coming into the bedroom,’ she replies.</p><p>The most unexpected moment of the interview comes when she reveals how she comforts herself after a gruelling day dealing with Jacob Rees-Mogg et al. </p><p>‘One of my little indulgences, I have to confess, is peanut butter.

But those caught end up being charged an average £50.</p><p>In some cases, charges amount to hundreds of pounds. It happens when disreputable directory enquiry providers ‘hijack’ out-of-use landline numbers and use them to play misleading adverts plugging services.</p><p>Bulks of 01 and 02 numbers are held by communications providers and can be sold via middlemen on to 118 providers to use.</p><p>When a caller misdials a number – or rings one they believe is still active for a person or business they know – they hear a recorded message on one of these hijacked numbers telling them that it is ‘out of service’ and to call a different number instead. Those who do as directed are tricked into using a pricey 118 service.</p><p>One customer who thought she was calling optician Specsavers was greeted with a recorded message saying the number was out of service – and that she should call 118 023. </p><p>Believing this to be a message recorded by the high street optician, she dialled the premium rate number – hanging up after realising her mistake. She was charged £7 for a 22-second call.</p><p>She says: ‘I was not advised of any charges when I listened to the message and was shocked to see the charge on my bill. I am extremely unhappy that people are getting away with scams like this.’</p><p>Another person was charged £25 for a call lasting less than six minutes. He had originally called a Northampton-based landline and was told to dial 118 023. When he rang and the operator found the number he was looking for, he was automatically connected.</p><p>This meant he was also charged the premium rate for the duration of the connected call – not just the initial contact with the 118 service.</p><p>A 93-year-old man who was recently discharged from hospital mistakenly dialled a number he believed was for an MOT centre based in Staffordshire. He was informed that the number was out of service and to call 118 023. Information about this number’s premium rate was not supplied until 26 seconds into the recorded message, but the victim had already hung up.</p><p>As a result of this rip-off, the company behind the 118 number – PowerTel – was fined £200,000 by the Phone-paid Services Authority, which regulates premium rate services. The fine was levied because the service’s cost was not clear, the tactic misleading, and the company had not renewed its registration with the regulator.</p><p>Back in March, a company known as ‘Call The 118 113 Helpdesk’ was also fined £425,000 for telling customers there was a fault on the landline they had phoned and to call premium rate number 118 820.</p><p>Complaints resolution service Resolver has heard from many people ripped off by 118 numbers.</p><p>Spokesman Martyn James says: ‘It is a sad fact that we cannot trust businesses to be honest about the pricing of telephone calls.’</p><p>PROTECTION IS COMING</p><p>Since PowerTel’s fine, the Phone-paid Services Authority has said it will ban companies from advertising directory enquiry services via ‘unused number squatting’. Promotions advertising 118 numbers will only be allowed to exist on active numbers already in use for other legitimate purposes.</p><p>Providers must also reveal the cost of onward call connections to numbers that customers request, giving them time to consider and decline. These changes take effect from early next February. Communications regulator Ofcom recently announced it will cap charges for all customers who call 118 numbers – typically elderly people and those without access to the internet – to a maximum £3.65 per 90 seconds.</p><p>Even that, of course, is eye-wateringly expensive. This comes after research showed around 450,000 people pay £2.4 million more than they expect to for directory enquiry services, leading to ‘bill shock’.</p><p>There are 86 providers offering more than 200 directory enquiry service numbers beginning with prefix 118.</p><p>Nearly 200,000 people pay more than £20 just to find a number. Ofcom’s changes will be introduced next April.</p><p>David Hickson, of the Fair Telecoms Campaign, says: ‘A major hope is that the price cap will drive some of the scammers away.’</p><p>He is also awaiting a final statement from the regulators on plans to tackle rip-off call connection services that trick people who search on the internet for numbers of well-established brands into making a premium rate call – when what they should be given is an 01, 02, 03 or free 080 number.</p><p>Throughout my life, I have been encouraged by friends to look forward, not backwards. But occasionally I cannot prevent my mind from wandering back in time, usually through rose-tinted spectacles, to remember aspects of life that really were better then than they are now.</p><p>A time when there was a bank and post office on every high street, town centres bustled with activity at a weekend, there was milk on the doorstep in the morning and a smartly dressed postman delivered letters with a smile and regular as clockwork twice a day.</p><p>Such a nostalgic moment coursed through my frame after reading Laura Shannon’s latest excellent exposé on the dreadful tricks companies are routinely pulling to fleece us when we use our telephones (see opposite).</p><p>Companies set up in theory to provide directory enquiry services but in practice designed to do little more than rob by fooling us to hang on an expensive premium rate line. Absolute daylight robbery.</p><p>After reading Laura’s work, I could not help but hark back to the 1970s and 1980s when you could ring 192 and ask some kindly operator for a phone number you were desperate to get hold of.</p><p>All for free, courtesy of BT. No tricks, just a friendly service.</p><p>When BT started charging for its 192 service in the 1990s, it was met with dismay by customers although it still continued to take some 600 million 192 calls a year.</p><p>It was also inevitable that as a result – sooner rather than later – BT would lose its monopolistic control of the directory enquiry service.</p><p>That duly happened in the early 2000s when the directory enquiries market was opened up to rampant competition. 192 was replaced by 118.</p><p>Today, competition in the 118 market remains intense, but the game has changed.</p><p>The growth of free-to-use directory enquiry services on the internet has prompted the 118 providers to ramp up charges and look at new (dastardly) ways of generating income.</p><p>The result is that many 118 users, a majority of whom fall into the elderly category, are being ripped off.</p><p>For the record, people aged 65 and over are four times more likely to use a 118 number than those aged between 16 and 34.</p><p>They are also ‘significantly’ less likely to have internet access so are unable to search for a number online.</p><p>The 118 market has resembled the Wild West for a while – and it is primarily a result of there being too little regulatory intervention.</p><p>As a result, a majority of customers remain clueless about how much the services cost – indeed some of the provider’s employees do not seem to know either.</p><p>Last week, when The Mail on Sunday contacted the operators of some of the most expensive lines, one said it charged £1 per call when actually it is nearer £16.</p><p>Another had no idea how much its 118 service cost. For the record, nine providers charge £15.98 per call plus £7.99 per minute.</p><p>As Laura’s report highlights, such sky-high 118 charges are particularly wicked when a caller is tricked into paying for them.</p><p>Not before time the regulators – Ofcom and The Phone-Paid Services Authority – have noticed the financial harm being done to people using 118 numbers.</p><p>As a result, from next year no company will be able to take over an out-of-use landline number to plug a pricey 118 service.</p><p>Then, from April, the cost of all 118 services will be capped at £3.65 – including VAT – per 90 seconds.</p><p>Hopefully, this will drive away many unscrupulous businesses although no doubt some will design new ways of robbing callers.</p><p>Scandalously, The Number UK – the company behind 118 118 – suggested the price cap should not be implemented for another three years. Outrageous.</p><p>Maybe a new dawn awaits us – where the 118 market, driven by a mix of competition and effective regulation, will deliver its customers value for money.</p><p>Cloud cuckoo land, methinks.</p><p> </p>', 'https://www.dailymail.co.uk/money/beatthescammers/article-6474787/The-callous-118-telephone-trick-costs-HUNDREDS-pounds-seconds.html');

And the tension in his boardroom in the heart of Mayfair is almost suffocating.</p><p>How does it feel to be asked such a question? ‘We can move on.’ Is it humiliating? ‘Move on.’ Has he been treated unfairly? ‘Move on. Move on.’</p><p>Eight months ago, this formidable 73-year-old – the epitome of one of novelist Tom Wolfe’s Masters of the Universe – had it all. He was the boss of WPP, a world-famous advertising firm he had built up from scratch into one of Britain’s biggest and most admired businesses. He had offices in all corners of the globe, with a workforce of 130,000. And he was a hero of British entrepreneurship, his views on the economy and markets sought after by investors and commentators worldwide.</p><p>How times change. Today, Sir Martin has left WPP, a company he led for 33 years and came to see as his own ‘baby’, and is now the boss of a comparative minnow, S4 Capital, with only a few employees at his beck and call.</p><p>And because none of them is working on a wintry Friday evening, it has been left to him – a man who has amassed personal wealth of £450 million and was a guest at Harry and Meghan’s wedding – to answer S4 Capital’s doorbell, trudge down to the entrance of his townhouse office and escort his interviewer up to the firm’s one-floor headquarters in a tiny, juddering old lift.</p><p>So how has he ended up acting the bell-boy and facing questions about paying for prostitutes on company expenses?</p><p>Sir Martin traces his Shakespearean change in fortune back to Thursday, March 29, this year. He was looking forward to a family holiday on the continent for the long Easter weekend. But before jetting off he had been asked to attend an interview in WPP’s London headquarters. The interview was conducted by WPP’s lawyers, the US firm WilmerHale.</p><p>The tone of the interview had not been at all what he was expecting. He discovered he faced a major investigation into alleged misuse of company money and improper behaviour.</p><p>A few days later the allegations appeared in the US press. Sir Martin says it was then, late on a Tuesday evening while he was still abroad and before British newspapers picked up the story, that he decided to quit WPP. His resignation was formalised less than a fortnight later, late on a Saturday evening, following the conclusion of the mysterious probe.</p><p>With little information revealed by WPP – the allegations remained secret thanks to a non-disclosure agreement – the City rumour mill immediately went into overdrive.</p><p>Reports surfaced that Sir Martin had paid for a prostitute on company expenses. Sorrell has strenuously denied the claim but until now has maintained a stony silence on how the ordeal has affected him.</p><p>Today, in an exclusive interview with The Mail on Sunday, Sir Martin pays tribute to his wife, Cristiana, and his family for the support they have given him over the past eight months and speaks of his ‘sadness’ at leaving WPP. And he also vows to be remembered for his entrepreneurial achievements rather than the lurid allegations that have sullied his name.</p><p>Sorrell’s new workplace is in a narrow townhouse on an exclusive street in the shadow of Buckingham Palace and, more importantly for this consummate deal-maker, a stone’s-throw from a string of high-quality restaurants where he breakfasts, lunches and has dinner with contacts.</p><p>After Sir Martin answers the door, we ascend the building in its narrow lift, awkwardly standing face to sternum. I’m reminded of some of the nicknames this diminutive tycoon – who claims to share Napoleon’s height, 5ft 6½in – has earned in the business world: Titch – ‘that was at school’, he says.</p><p>The 21st of June (or the Shortest Knight, geddit?) – ‘yeah, that’s a variant of Titch’.</p><p>Mad Dwarf – ‘it’s a variant of Titch as well’.</p><p>Odious Little Jerk – ‘it wasn’t Odious Little Jerk – it was Odious Little S***’.</p><p>As we take our seats in S4 Capital’s boardroom, Sorrell must know that a barrage of unwanted questions are coming his way. But he makes clear he’s not going to make my job easy. ‘There won’t be any tough questions – I won’t answer any tough questions,’ he says, fixing me with a steely glare.</p><p>Sir Martin, smartly dressed as ever in a suit and tie, initially sticks to his word, batting it all off with the words ‘move on, move on’.</p><p>He maintains a rigid posture behind his vast boardroom table, his hands clasped, reinforcing the message that nothing will break his resolve.</p><p>But eventually he starts to soften. ‘It’s not been easy,’ he finally admits. ‘But I’ve had a lot of support and counsel from all my family and friends – and people inside WPP.’</p><p>His family include second wife Cristiana, who is 30 years his junior, and their two-year-old daughter, Bianca.</p><p>From his first marriage he has three adult sons, all of whom work in the City, and grandchildren. How did his family deal with the allegations, I ask. ‘We talked about it,’ he says. ‘But that’s a private matter.’</p><p>Sorrell rubbishes any suggestion of marital problems.</p><p>‘That’s not a question I’m going to dignify with an answer,’ he says, adding: ‘Anybody who really knows me, knows the allegation and surrounding innuendo were fabricated.’</p><p>But he does admit that some people will believe what’s been written about him.</p><p>‘Some people look at it and believe it, and some people don’t,’ he says. ‘I think you have to be philosophical about it.’</p><p>Sorrell insists he has experienced ‘tougher moments’ in his life. This may be hard to believe. But he has had a more colourful life than most of his peers in the business world.</p><p>Brought up as an only child (a brother died in childbirth) in a Jewish household in North London, Sorrell attended Cambridge and Harvard universities before entering the world of commerce.</p><p>He flew beneath the radar in his early years, but rose to prominence after being made finance boss of advertising firm Saatchi & Saatchi. As he helped build it into a global giant, Sorrell became known as the ‘third Saatchi’ brother, after founders Maurice and Charles.</p><p>At 40, Sorrell broke off on his own. He bought an obscure basket maker called Wire And Plastic Products, renamed it WPP Group and – against all odds – built it up into the largest advertising company in the world, overtaking Saatchi & Saatchi. To get there, Sorrell bought up some of the best-known companies in the advertising world, making plenty of enemies along the way. His Odious Little S*** nickname came about when WPP bought Ogilvy Group. Its founder David Ogilvy, known as the Father of Advertising, bestowed the title upon Sorrell.</p><p>Sir Martin points out that this comment was made before the two had met, and that Ogilvy – whom he later made chairman of WPP – later apologised.</p><p>Sir Martin was knighted in 2000 – when he earned his 21st June nickname from jealous industry peers – for his incredible rise in the business world. But all was not well in his personal life.</p><p>In 2005, his marriage of 33 years to Sandra, mother to his three sons, broke down and ended in a public divorce court. He was ordered to pay her a record £29 million, which included their £3.25 million Georgian townhouse in Central London.</p><p>Sorrell was back in court two years later. This time, he was suing two former colleagues who allegedly posted anonymous messages online about a short-lived relationship he had with WPP’s chief operating officer in Italy at that time.</p><p>One message was said to have described Sir Martin and the woman as ‘the mad dwarf and the nympho schizo’.</p><p>The case was settled out of court for a reported £120,000 but, controversially, WPP shareholders were left to pick up legal fees he had accrued up to that point totalling £800,000.</p><p>Sir Martin married his second wife Cristiana, an Italian economist, in 2008. He provoked rage among WPP investors a couple of years later when it emerged that the company was paying for her travel expenses.</p><p>The controversy led to one of many run-ins between WPP’s chief executive and his shareholders.</p><p>‘My wife has made and continues to make a significant contribution to what I do,’ Sorrell argues. ‘What she does is extremely significant.’ He later agreed to start paying her expenses personally.</p><p>Sir Martin has regularly been the FTSE 100’s best-paid chief executive, taking home more than £200 million between 2012 and 2016 alone. Sorrell says he has no regrets. He points out that a large amount of his pay was actually in bonus form, meaning it was dependent on his performance. He also says contrasts between himself, a man who invested in his own company and built it up from scratch, and those brought in to manage big businesses, are not fair.</p><p>‘I was totally committed to the enterprise,’ he says. ‘I fundamentally believe that people in companies like WPP should make an investment, which I did.’</p><p>Despite animosity between himself and the board, after resigning from WPP on April 14 this year, Sorrell carried on working for the firm for a month and even secured some significant business.</p><p>‘Things had to be handled,’ he says. ‘You can’t just cut it off just like that. There were contractual negotiations going on with clients. I was involved in negotiating a major [advertising] contract.</p><p>‘The client said that the only person he was prepared to deal with in relation to the renewal was myself… that was one of the last things I did for WPP.’</p><p>Sorrell, notably relaxed now the conversation has moved on from prostitution, also grasps this opportunity to explain why he is both a good founder and a good manager. ‘There are people who are good at starting businesses, and there are people who are good at running businesses,’ he says.</p><p>‘Rarely do you find both sets of talent in one person.’</p><p>Yet around the time of the prostitution allegation, Sir Martin also faced accusations that he had been a ‘brutal and inhuman’ boss. How does he reconcile that with his claim he’s good at running businesses? ‘I’ve said before, I always like to have things done well,’ he shoots back. ‘If at any point they weren’t done well, I was concerned about that. But if things were executed well, everything was fine.’</p><p>It was also reported that staff had been upset when he sacked his chauffeur of 15 years after he refused to pick up Cristiana from a restaurant at 2am because he had another job five hours later.</p><p>Despite still owning a near- two per cent stake in WPP, Sir Martin has turned into the firm’s most vocal critic since leaving: he recently described it as being a ‘car crash in slow motion’.</p><p>Sir Martin turns 74 in February, he has a young daughter and grandchildren nearby, and money is no concern for him and his family. But after leaving WPP, he chose to launch himself straight into a new job without taking a break.</p><p>‘Having gone through what I went through, I decided in May to embark on a new enterprise,’ he says. ‘A clean sheet of paper. It’s obviously not easy – because the good news is you have a clean sheet of paper, the bad news is that I obviously miss the scale of WPP.</p><p>‘But we’re starting to build a good operation… and I think it can actually be really exciting.

Will it be the making of him – after all, he loves films? Or will he decide it’s not for him, resulting in a change in career path and more worry for myself and his mother Susan?</p><p>Although many young adults adapt effortlessly to full-time work, employment also triggers other issues, mainly of a financial nature. </p><p>Work brings a degree of independence and a series of key money decisions to make. Choices that are often made against a backdrop of little knowledge of money – and a financial services industry that seems intent on making the simple complicated.</p><p>Should they join the company pension scheme as instructed or would it be wiser to opt out while money is tight? How do they arrange finances so they do not slip into debt? Should they try to save?</p><p>Charity MyBnk has done a lot of groundbreaking work helping young people get to grips with money issues. Fiona Montgomery, educational manager, says: ‘For a young person, embarking on a career is exciting, but it can also be overwhelming and stressful. They are faced with paying taxes, maybe living independently and, of course, enjoying the relative freedom of being a young adult earning money. This time is one where good or bad money habits are formed.’</p><p>So what are the key financial issues we should be encouraging our children to get to grips with as they embark on their career?</p><p>BUDGETING</p><p>While a monthly salary may bring sudden financial independence, it is vital you urge your grown-up children to budget – and not blow every penny they earn on their new-found ‘wealth’. Even if they live far away from the family home and you have to deliver your promptings by email or phone.</p><p>Warren Shute is a successful chartered financial planner who has spent his life trying to debunk personal finance. </p><p>He is author of The Money Plan (Amazon, £11.79) that aims to help people achieve ‘financial mastery’ irrespective of where they are on their personal finance journey.</p><p>He advises newbies in the workplace to get to grips with their payslips, analysing the deductions (income tax and national insurance) that reduce their gross pay down to a net sum. Budgeting is then the order of the day. ‘As a parent, you do not need to tell them to become a budgeting nerd,’ says Shute. ‘You just have to gently push them to take control of their finances.’</p><p>He advises that new workers try to pay all their main bills by direct debit or standing order from their bank account – for example core expenses such as rent, gas, electricity, council tax and water rates.</p><p>He then recommends that they pay themselves a weekly allowance into a separate ‘spending’ account – for example, an instant access savings account. Regular withdrawals can then be used to buy food and fund social activities.</p><p>‘When the weekly allowance has gone, it is time to stop spending,’ says Shute. ‘Using such a system will ensure someone never overspends or misses a payment.’</p><p>He advises: ‘Never spend more than you earn and never borrow money to cover your lifestyle.’</p><p>Modern digital banks such as Monzo provide spending summaries and allow customers to set budgets. A free budget planner is available at website Moneyadviceservice.org.uk</p><p>PENSION</p><p>For those aged 22 or over and earning more than £10,000, an employer will automatically enrol them into the work pension scheme.</p><p>This means that as a minimum, the employee will pay two per cent of their salary into the pension with the Government and employer adding a further contribution equivalent to three per cent. These contributions are based on earnings between £6,032 and £46,350.</p><p>From next April, overall minimum contributions will rise to eight per cent, with employees paying three per cent.</p><p>Holly Mackay, founder of money website Boring Money, says: ‘In most cases, opting out of a company pension scheme makes no sense.</p><p>‘As a solid base for long-term savings, it represents a good bet. In effect a worker gets a free pension top-up from their employer and the Government, the benefit of which will just tick away in the background for years.’</p><p>She says that some big employers may also match any extra contributions a worker is prepared to make. An attractive ‘perk’ for those happy to receive a little less net pay.</p><p>FINANCIAL TOOLS</p><p>Getting a job is often a good time to reassess whether it is time to change bank accounts.</p><p>A few banks such as Nationwide and Santander (123 account) now pay interest on a slice of any credit balance provided a salary comes into the account.</p><p>In addition, some such as Santander pay cashback if certain bills are paid through the account by direct debit. Those who are comfortable doing their banking digitally should look at the likes of Monzo and Starling. Switching bank accounts is now straightforward. Websites such as Moneysupermarket.com and Money.co.uk can help find suitable accounts.</p><p>Those dependent upon a car to drive to work can keep a lid on insurance costs by accepting a higher excess – a slice of any claim that they must pay – or opting for a telematics-based policy where premiums are dependent upon how well a motorist drives. Even a job title can influence premiums – cover for an editor is invariably cheaper than for a journalist as it is for a personal assistant rather than a secretary. </p><p>Also, do not forget that some attractive travel discounts are still available after university – such as the £30 16-to-25 railcard that provides a 30 per cent discount on train fares.</p><p>DEBT </p><p>For most graduates, debt is an inevitable consequence of spending three years at university.</p><p>At some stage repayments on any outstanding student loan will have to be made although this will happen automatically with deductions made from gross pay.</p><p>Repayments are equivalent to nine per cent of any salary above a threshold of £25,000. So earnings of £27,000 will result in an annual payment of £180 – a monthly £15 reduction in salary. The earliest any payments can be taken are from the start of the next tax year after graduation. So someone who graduated this year could start making repayments from April 6 next year.</p><p>If credit card debt has been accumulated, paying this down should be a priority. Financial planner Warren Shute says: ‘Repaying debt is an essential first step – before saving towards a house deposit or investing for the future.’</p><p>Shute is a fan of the ‘snowball debt repayment method’ for young workers with multiple debts. ‘As a parent, encourage them to repay the smallest debt first before moving on towards the next,’ he says. ‘This will keep them motivated to repay all their debts as they see loans cleared and real progress made.’</p><p>SAVING</p><p>While saving – on top of pension contributions – may not be a priority for someone starting work, it can reap long-term rewards. A tax-efficient Individual Savings Account, invested in shares or investment funds, is an ideal starting place. They can be set up online and are flexible to use.</p><p>Shute encourages young workers to adopt the ‘100 minus age rule’. This means that someone who is aged 25 should have 75 per cent of their Isa in equities – the rest in fixed interest bonds. He is also a big advocate of the use of low-cost funds that track the performance of a stock market. Big brands include BlackRock and Vanguard.</p><p>Mackay is a fan of the ‘pay yourself first’ rule. This involves diverting 20 per cent of any pay rise in the future into an Isa. She adds: ‘By doing this a worker does not miss what they never had.’</p><p>For new workers with one eye on a home, a tax-friendly Lifetime Isa is also an option. This allows anyone between the ages of 18 and 40 to save a maximum £4,000 a tax year – with the Government providing a ‘free’ 25 per cent top-up. Providers include building societies Newcastle, Nottingham and Skipton.</p><p>A Help to Buy Isa is an alternative – details at helptobuy.gov.uk.</p><p> </p>', 'https://www.dailymail.co.uk/money/article-6474685/JEFF-PRESTRIDGE-stop-little-darling-blowing-penny-land-job.html');

Since the Bastille fortress was stormed by the people of Paris on July 14, 1789, the country has got rid of three kings, two emperors and several presidents, and has worked its way, often violently, through 15 constitutions.</p><p>Every time there has been a major uprising, it has taken everyone by surprise. The last king had to escape hastily from Paris in a hansom cab, and reached England on a Channel ferry disguised as Bill Smith. Indeed, every French monarch since 1815, and the first president of every republic, spent time as an exile in Britain.</p><p>France’s Fifth Republic is a fairly remote system of government. Power is concentrated in the Elysee Palace and parliament is downgraded. So people – workers, farmers, students, immigrants, pensioners – often feel their only way of being heard is to cause mayhem. Monarchy tempered by riot, one might say. And out-of-touch presidents never see it coming. It’s become almost a ritual.</p><p>Now, once again, France’s rulers have been taken by surprise and all they can do is call out the riot squads.</p><p>What began as a protest against fuel taxes has turned into a general movement of frustration and anger. </p><p>Anger against what people feel to be the injustices and inequalities that stem from the great crash of 2007-08, and against the fact that the rich and clever seem never to suffer, while (as the French say) ‘it’s always the same ones who pay’. </p><p>The French economy has been underperforming for years. Unemployment, especially among the young, has been chronically high.</p><p>But Macron’s problem is also a European problem, and a problem for Europe. A European problem because it is the French variant of a widening gulf between rulers and ruled that we see across the continent.</p><p>For a generation, people have put up with stagnant wages, permanent unemployment, rising inequality and mass immigration. Power has been taken away from democratic national governments, often with their consent, and vested in distant and unaccountable bodies – trade organisations, international courts, and above all, the EU.</p><p>Being president of the Fifth Republic – the nearest thing to an elected monarch – is a difficult job, perhaps an impossible one. On one hand, the French want their president to embody the greatness of France. They didn’t forgive Sarkozy and Hollande for looking vulgar and ridiculous.</p><p>But they also want the president to listen to them, to seem at least sometimes to be a man of the people who feels their pain. Good King Wenceslas rather than Sun King Louis. President Jacques Chirac sometimes managed this, slapping cows’ rumps at agricultural shows and eating man-sized slices of pâté de campagne washed down with a glass or two of Rhone.</p><p>With all his faults, he was liked. But this is not Macron’s style. He is too fastidious. When first elected he said he wanted to be like the god Jupiter, high in the clouds. He has been sharply brought down to earth. Why did Macron think he was a different kind of monarch? A veteran French journalist who knows him told me: ‘You have to remember that all his life he’s been the cleverest man in the room.’ And now his cleverness has proved to be not enough. Perhaps even a handicap.</p><p>He has some remarkable political gifts. He’s determined and charismatic. But he doesn’t suffer fools gladly, and sometimes he seems to think the electors are pretty dim.</p><p>Well, General de Gaulle thought so too, but he kept it to himself. Macron sometimes shows it, and people are increasingly resentful of a man who seems remote and disdainful. </p><p>They don’t like being talked down to by a young man in a sharp suit, the embodiment of so much they resent. The rapid fall in his popularity and the venom with which people now talk about him is astonishing.</p><p>Macron will surely survive, however. There is practically no way of removing a French president, and with the mobilisation of 80,000 police and gendarmes, with armoured vehicles in reserve, there will be no revolution.</p><p>There hasn’t been one in peacetime since 1848. The riots will peter out. But Macron cannot recover the position he once had. People have been shocked by the anger and violence on display, and by footage of 150 schoolchildren made by police to kneel in the mud with their hands behind their heads, like captured terrorists.</p><p>Macron has backed down and tried to buy off the demonstrators, and I suspect this means that his chance of really changing France and rejuvenating the economy has gone for good.</p><p>And this brings us back to the EU. Macron has put himself forward as the saviour of the European project, which he claims is facing collapse unless it he leads it into the next stage of integration – what he calls a ‘sovereign Europe’, ultimately in charge of finances, taxation, welfare, labour law and immigration.</p><p>His effort to reform the French economy and cut spending is spurred on by determination to reduce France’s public borrowing below the EU target of three per cent.</p><p>Only by doing so could he make good his claim to European leadership, as at least the equal of Germany. That too now seems a pipe dream. Where will France and the EU go from here? The future is unpredictable, and it is not very bright.</p><p>When people feel they are no longer heard by the elites, protest becomes more vehement. We see it in various forms from Spain to Hungary. In France, it leads to burning cars and looted shops. In Britain, it leads to Brexit. France has once again provided us with a dramatic spectacle of what can happen when a political system implodes.</p><p>In Britain, too, we need to heed the warning. If people feel those in power despise them, sooner or later they react.</p>', 'https://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-6475677/ROBERT-TOMBS-French-protests-warning-Europe.html');

No way! Well, maybe the last bit… Five Gen Zeds reveal all to Judith Woods </p><p>We know that Generation Z disapprove of everything their parents do, but what do they actually approve of? Born just after the Millennials, they’re aged up to 23 and will be ruling the country within a couple of decades (or sooner, if they have their way). Variously seen as airheads who crave 15 minutes of bikini-clad fame on Love Island, or militant vegans who hate the thought of hurting an avocado, the truth is probably somewhere in between. We lured five members of Generation Z into an Insta-friendly photo studio and put them under the YOU magazine microscope to find out who they really are.</p><p>Do you actually eat avocado with everything?</p><p>It would seem that the Millennials’ fave is losing traction: only three of our Zeds enjoy it. Sam actively dislikes it. Lewys will eat it if someone else mashes it.</p><p>Are you really just wasting time on your phone all day?</p><p>Our Zeds bemoan their social media addiction, but still indulge. Addictively. ‘You know that function on your phone that tells you how long you’ve spent on social media?’ asks Lewys. ‘I just don’t want to know.’ Sagal admits she’s obsessed. Bella is conflicted: ‘We know social media sites are designed to keep us hooked, but it’s hard to tear ourselves away…’</p><p>Is it true you never get drunk?</p><p>‘Of course we drink! I’m not sure why older people think we don’t,’ says Lewys. ‘The distinction is that we drink to get drunk, but we can live without it. Parents seem to think two glasses of wine a night is a human right.’ Drugs such as ecstasy (MDMA) are so prevalent as to be unremarkable. ‘Some people prefer to smoke [cannabis] than drink. But either way, it’s been normalised,’ says Bella. Jude is the exception – he doesn’t drink because of alcoholism in his family. ‘I drink still mineral water; but it doesn’t make me boring.’</p><p>Is there anything you pay more attention to than Netflix?</p><p>When it comes to the environment, Generation Z aren’t as engaged as Millennials, although they cannily (cynically?) grasp the kudos of paying lip service to worthy causes. ‘I retweet stuff about saving polar bears,’ admits Jude, ‘but I have no idea what’s wrong with them.’ Sagal worries about plastic bottles. Bella and Sam feel no reproach towards the older generation for trashing the planet and driving diesel cars. ‘It’s not as though they knew the damage they were causing,’ argues Sam.</p><p>Do you really only wear expensive sportswear?</p><p>Comfort matters more than high fashion and nobody wants to look the same as everyone else. Mix and match is the dress code, and it doesn’t matter which gender it was made for. ‘I believe fashion has no labels,’ says Lewys. ‘I often wear clothes from shops targeted at females – at the end of the day, it’s a piece of fabric.’ Everyone agrees they haven’t got the cash for ethical or sustainable clothing but would like to think they might in the future.</p><p>What would you do if you were Prime Minister for the day?</p><p>Jude would reinstate the death penalty. ‘Rapists and murderers should be hanged in public,’ he says. ‘That’s very important; we need to watch them pay the price for their crimes. Oh, and potholes – someone needs to sort them out.’ Sagal would outlaw all prejudice. Bella would sort the NHS. The others reckon they could bring about world peace, which shows admirable faith in the power of British democracy.</p><p>Living your best life When what you are doing is helping you live your life to its full potential: ‘I’m eating avocado on toast and living my best life.’</p><p>Lit Can either be used to describe an exciting situation or being intoxicated: ‘Let’s get lit tonight.’</p><p>Turn up (or turnt up) It’s time to party.</p><p>Slay Describing someone who looks good and is confident about it: ‘You slay, girl!’</p><p>Yaaas queen A positive affirmation, used to greet someone living their best life.</p><p>Boujee An abbreviation of bourgeois, used to describe something that’s high class: ‘Your nails are so boujee!’</p><p>Basic A putdown derived from the term ‘basic bitch’ (someone who is only interested in mainstream fashion and trends). Often used to describe someone who is devoid of any interesting characteristics: ‘You’re so basic.’</p><p>Extra Used to describe over-the-top, dramatic behaviour: ‘She’s so extra!’</p><p>Cancelled Describing something or someone who is no longer relevant to your life, also something that is not politically correct: ‘You’re cancelled.’</p><p>Vibey Used to describe a good atmosphere: ‘It’s vibey in here.’</p><p>Bae Acronym of Before Anyone Else, it’s also another word for someone’s boyfriend or girlfriend.</p><p>Af Shortened version of ‘as f***’, used to exaggerate something’s meaning: ‘You’re basic af.’</p><p>Okurrr Formerly ‘OK’, this version is spun out by rolling your tongue.</p><p>Woke Alert to racial or social discrimination and injustice; frequently in ‘stay woke’</p><p> </p><p>What age do you consider ‘old’?</p><p>‘Sixty plus, says Sagal. ‘Old is someone who’s retired. My dad is in his 50s and he doesn’t seem old to me. Plus, I work with people who are in their 50s and I know they are still living their best lives.’</p><p>Do you prefer screens to sex?</p><p>‘People our age are having loads of sex,’ says Sagal. ‘Hook-up apps mean they don’t even have to waste an evening on a one-night stand – they can meet someone immediately and have half the day left.’ She says it like that’s a good thing. But maybe it is. Bella observes that ‘friends with benefits’ (a commitment-free sexual relationship) is the norm at college and that it’s rare for anyone to go home with a stranger after clubbing. Much better to pick up the phone and make a booty call (a late-night invitation to have sex). ‘Maybe Millennials are thought to be less sexually active because they’ve had their crazy years?’ suggests Sagal.</p><p>What’s your dream job?</p><p>Being a full-time YouTuber – like Lewys – would be top of the list. ‘We’re not just on social media all day because it’s entertaining,’ says Lewys. ‘It’s my work. There are so many 21st-century jobs out there that older generations have no idea about.’</p><p>Do you take offence very easily?</p><p>While Millennials are known for their passive-aggressive insistence on safe spaces and taking offence, our Zeds claim to be more relaxed. ‘Live and let live,’ says Bella. Sam concurs: ‘I don’t care whether someone is a vegan or non-binary as long as they don’t lecture me about their views.’</p><p>Are snowflakes [a term for hyper-sensitive, politically correct young people] a figment of our imagination?</p><p>‘What are they?’ asks Jude. ‘Never heard of them.’ The others are measured: ‘I get why the term is used by great-grandparents who’ve lived through wars, but it’s not an accurate description of young people,’ reflects Bella. ‘Life is hard and we have lots of pressures.’ Sam spells it out: ‘Being aware of injustice and prejudice doesn’t make us weak or snowflakey. Our generation has helped to highlight important issues, such as mental health.’</p><p>Do you worry you’ll still be living in a flatshare in your 40s?</p><p>Although not all of them have hit the job market yet, this buoyant bunch expects to be on the property ladder by their early 30s. ‘My music is gonna make me rich!’ cries Jude. ‘I’ll be in my penthouse with loads of cars, drinking mineral water.’ Everybody cheers. Their positivity is refreshing.</p><p>Do your parents embarrass you?</p><p>‘I love my mum, she’s so cute,’ sighs Bella. And Sagal. And Sam. And Lewys and Jude. ‘I used to disapprove of my mum drinking wine but now I drink it with her,’ Bella adds. Lewys (sort of) wishes his mum would stop boasting about him to friends. Sagal’s mum deliberately sings Ed Sheeran songs in public to embarrass her. Sam has set up a Snapchat group with her parents. Everyone agrees this is beyond cute.</p><p>Is eating meat the new smoking?</p><p>‘I tried to go vegan but buying special food was too expensive,’ sighs Sagal. ‘It was also tiring having to find alternative protein sources.’ Bella is pescatarian, the others are flexitarian, apart from Jude who ‘lives’ on red meat. Sam would like to be vegetarian for environmental reasons: ‘I love meat so it would be difficult, and I can’t see how just me not buying a steak will stop supermarkets selling it.’</p><p>What would you hate your parents to know?</p><p>There’s very little that Zeds feel is off-limits. ‘There’s not much my mum and dad don’t know about me,’ says Jude. ‘My parents are more like friends. Of course, we don’t discuss my sex life, but that’s just because it’s private.’ Bella concurs: ‘I have a great relationship with my parents – nothing is taboo.’</p><p>If you didn’t Instagram it, did it even happen?</p><p>‘No,’ says Sagal. ‘It depends on where I am – if I am out with my friends having fun then it’s become natural to take a picture and post it. But if the lighting is bad, it’s not going on my Instagram grid.’</p><p>Are you looking forward to working into your 70s?</p><p>This is very important. ‘I want to work really hard in my 20s then take it easy in my 30s and enjoy the rest of my life,’ says Lewys. Oh dear, who’s going to break the news to him? </p><p>Hair: Alex Szabo. Make-up: Beth Alderson</p><p> </p>', 'https://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/you/article-6458917/Gen-Z-Special-rule-world.html');

The only point of it was to fend off the madmen who are so blinded by dogmatic frenzy that they want a Tory leadership challenge and a General Election, and to hell with the country.</p><p>The May plan has prevented that until now. It has also left a tiny passage through which we might escape into calm and sanity. </p><p>I have, for some time, urged that we take the Norway option, out of the EU, away from its courts and its wasteful farm and fishery policies, with access to a powerful emergency brake on immigration but still able to trade through the Single Market.</p><p>It is still just possible that, in the weeks of closed minds and jockeying that seem likely to come about, enough calm heads will grasp this. </p><p>There could actually be a majority for it. It would be miles better than any other feasible outcome.</p><p>But it is like that bit at the end of the adventure story where the hero, pursued by implacable enemies, has to leap from a tottering, crumbling bridge on to a meagre ledge below, and then swing himself into the tiny opening to safety. </p><p>In the story, you know he is going to do it. </p><p>But in British politics, it is far more likely that he’ll miss his footing and fall screaming into the chasm, taking the rest of us with him. Well, you can’t say I didn’t warn you.</p><p>Even the Left-wingers at The Guardian are a bit perplexed by the number of lesbian films we seem to be getting in our cinemas now, from action-thrillers such as The Girl In The Spider’s Web to The Favourite, out soon, which suggests that poor old Queen Anne throbbed with same-sex passion.</p><p>Perhaps most irritating is a much-praised drama called Disobedience, starring Rachel Weisz as a modish British photographer in Manhattan who, while not taking pictures of pathetic tattooed old men, or smoking hard enough to keep warm, is having vigorous heterosexual encounters in lavatories. </p><p>Suddenly her father, a very strictly Orthodox rabbi, dies in mid-sermon. Back she goes to London for the funeral. </p><p>There she irritates everyone by her contempt for their faith, her smoking and, finally, by seducing another rabbi’s wife in a park, and later in a hotel, destroying their marriage and endangering the rabbi’s faith.</p><p>Of course, it’s the devout Jews with their ancient respect for God and scripture who are portrayed as the difficulty. This sort of propaganda can always get money and publicity.</p><p>How I wish the same attention had been paid to the beautiful, brilliant Polish film Ida, which avoids all these weary cliches and is, as a result, one of the best and most neglected films of the past ten years.</p><p>You may recall Professor Alice Roberts, the TV star and Humanist zealot, who made such a fuss about how she could not find places for her children in non-church schools. </p><p>She said: ‘Seven out of the nearest nine schools to me were Church of England schools. I applied to the two which weren’t and we did not get in there.’</p><p>The accounts of this clearly stated that she lived in Bristol. I was a bit baffled about this. </p><p>Bristol council told me that, of the 108 state schools in the city that take primary pupils, just 26 have church affiliations. </p><p>So there are 82 non-church schools, roughly two per square mile. This is probably fairly typical, as about 7,000 of 20,000 state schools in England are church schools, but many of the church schools are concentrated in rural areas.</p><p>I do not know or seek to know where exactly Prof Roberts lives. But it seems to me that, if it is so important to her to send her children to a non-church state primary school, she ought to have been able to find something to her liking among 82 possible schools in her home city. </p><p>When I put this to the Humanists, they revealed that she doesn’t in fact live in Bristol at all. </p><p>Coyly, they said: ‘Without disclosing where Alice lives, I am afraid your premise, that she lives in the boundaries of the city proper, is faulty.’ </p><p>Perhaps, I wondered, she’d chosen to live in a country area, where the chances of finding a church school are known to be high. Who can blame her? But, in that case, was her complaint valid?</p><p>When I tried to discover more from the Humanists, they suggested wrongly that I was seeking to know where she lived, and then fell silent.</p><p>Once again The Sutton Trust does excellent research on the terrible state of our schools. Once again, driven by ideology, it misses the point. </p><p>The revelation that eight expensive private schools together scored as many Oxbridge places as 2,894 state schools will delight Left-wing fanatics, who will pretend it’s the result of Oxbridge snobbery.</p><p>In fact, the two great universities strive very hard to encourage applicants from poor backgrounds. But atrocious, disorderly state secondaries don’t teach them well enough, and too many of their teachers, in the grip of inverted snobbery, sulkily refuse to encourage children to apply for top colleges. </p><p>That’s only the half of it. The Sutton figures, read carefully, show that academically selective state grammar schools come close to matching the vastly expensive public schools in gaining Oxbridge places.</p><p>Alas, there are hardly any of them. In the days when we had a national network of state grammar schools, 64.6 per cent of their pupils came from working class homes, according to the Gurney-Dixon report of 1954. </p><p>And most survived into the sixth form, in those pre-expansion days the equivalent of university. The Crowther Report of 1959 found more than 40 per cent of sixth-formers at grammar schools were working class. What ‘outstanding’ comprehensive or academy can say that today?</p><p>By 1964, these bright boys and girls from working class homes were storming Oxford and Cambridge, beating the expensive private schools without any special help or concessions. Then that stopped, when all but a tiny rump of grammars were smashed up in the egalitarian lunacy of the 1960s.</p><p>Watching ‘experts’ and politicians discussing education is like being in a nightmare. </p><p>In that awful dream, I have to watch, powerless, while a surgeon kills a patient because he refuses to use the only procedure which could have saved him.</p>', 'https://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-6474983/PETER-HITCHENS-Tories-drag-nation-abyss-say-did-warn-you.html');

Here’s the truth about a charity ploy that will really get your goat', 'Toby walne for the Daily Mail', '<p>People seeking presents that help a good cause this Christmas are being urged to think twice before buying a ‘live gift’ for a struggling community in a far-flung country. </p><p>Such gifts are often no more than clever marketing tricks to encourage you to donate money.</p><p>Charities such as Oxfam are selling cards with lovable-looking animals pictured on them emblazoned with messages such as: ‘I got you a very special goat.’ The gift costs £25. </p><p>For £13 you can buy a friend or relative a ‘life-changing chicken’ while £46 purchases a ‘pair of poverty-busting pigs’.</p><p>In reality, the cash pours into a big Oxfam charity pot ‘to help people living in poverty’. Although the gift money aims to meet Oxfam’s mission to ‘beat poverty for good’, some of it may end up being absorbed by the £126 million-a-year wage bill the charity pays for employing more than 5,000 staff. Eleven employees are taking home £100,000 or more a year.</p><p>Hilary Blume is founder of the Charities Advisory Trust that helps good causes raise funds effectively. </p><p>She says: ‘The use of such gifts may be no more than a cynical way of getting money out of people. Only in the small print do the cards make it clear that the money is going where it is needed. One has to ask if it could end up going towards the chief executive’s six-figure salary.’</p><p>Oxfam is one of the worst offenders but others touting virtual ‘charity gifts’ include the World Wide Fund for Nature. It wants you to adopt an animal such as a polar bear or orang-utan. In return, you get a cuddly toy, stickers and regular updates.</p><p>Another is the Catholic Agency For Overseas Development that sells ‘chirpy chickens’ and ‘fantastic fish’ for £20 each. The reality is that any cash generated from sales just goes into a large fund.</p><p>Blume adds: ‘There is an erosion in ethical standards among fundraisers with some exploiting people’s goodwill – selling a goat that is not a goat. Integrity and honesty can sometimes go out of the window when charities are looking at new ways to raise money.’</p><p>In response, Oxfam said on Friday: ‘Our website explains where money goes from all gifts made so people know how they are helping to fight poverty. </p><p>''Gifts like the one for a goat make it possible for us to help poor families build a better life.’</p><p>World Wide Fund for Nature said: ‘We always make it clear to gift buyers that donations directly support the species that has been adopted – as well as helping our wider work to protect nature.’</p><p>For those concerned about the destination of their donation, Blume says people can get certainty about where their gift money ends up.</p><p>For example, the Good Gifts project, organised by the Charities Advisory Trust, enables someone to make a £27 donation, knowing it will purchase 18 pairs of flip-flops to help prevent African children from being infected by hookworm – an intestinal parasite which can be picked up from walking barefoot. </p><p> Also, £145 donated towards the installation of a deep pump designed to access clean water will be spent on just that. Oxfam generated income of £427 million in the year ending March 2018, of which nearly half came from the Government and public organisations. </p><p>Around £99 million was received from donations and legacies, which includes ‘animal’ charity gifts. A further £94 million came from trading sales.</p><p>According to independent research by the charity directory Charity Choice, for every £1 spent by Oxfam in the year to March 2017, 64p went on ‘charitable activities’ while for World Wide Fund for Nature it was 82p.</p><p>Lydia Marshall, of the Advertising Standards Authority, said: ‘In looking at advertising material, context and content are key.’</p><p>Insurer Aviva has upheld a promise to the MoS more than a year ago to end its price discrimination against loyal customers.</p><p>The company says it will soon launch home and car insurance policies that will provide buyers with a guarantee – that when they come to renew, they will not pay more than someone purchasing cover at the same time but as a new customer. Indeed, existing customers may pay less. The new policies, labelled AvivaPlus, are a direct result of our longstanding ‘broken loyalty’ campaign. Mark Wilson, Aviva’s boss at the time, promised to address the issue in a meeting with the paper’s personal finance editor.</p><p>The insurer’s own research shows that four out of five consumers consider the price disparity one of the industry’s most unfair practices.</p><p>Andy Briggs, Aviva’s new chief executive, said he was intent on ‘creating a level playing field’.

I think we all recognise that this is a good deal'', she insisted.</p><p>Mrs May is privately furious that the Brexit ''ultras'', including Jacob Ress-Mogg and Boris Johnson, are so determined to crash her deal that they will topple a line of dominos which could lead to a vote of no confidence, the end of Mrs May''s leadership, the suspension of Article 50, a General Election ushering in a Labour-SNP Government and a second referendum to attempt to reverse Brexit. As one ally says: ''We would go to hell in a handcart''.</p><p>But while large sections of her Parliamentary party remain unconvinced by her deal and her determination to put it to a vote, Mrs May says she has been cheered by more than 3,000 personal messages of support from ordinary voters.</p><p>''I''ve had a lot of letters, a lot of emails, a lot of support from people,'' she says. ''It really has been encouraging. The overwhelming message from people is: let''s get this deal done and then we can focus on the future. People say, ''look, we just wish you the best because we really want to see Brexit and we want to get on with this.''</p><p>Mrs May – one of the most effective stonewallers in Westminster –deflects all questions about whether she will resign if she is defeated over the deal or go back to Brussels to demand more concessions.</p><p>But she is openly dismissive about moves by a cross-party group of MPs, led by Tory MP Sarah Wollaston, to call a second referendum – and withering about her predecessor Tony Blair''s call for one.</p><p>''His view is that we should go for another referendum,'' she said. ''We had a people''s vote, that''s what frustrates me when people talk about this, the second referendum being a people''s vote. We had a people''s vote, let''s deliver on the first people''s vote.''</p><p>The prospect of another General Election, particularly after last year''s fiasco, chills many Tory MPs, who argue that the party machine is not ready to fight a successful campaign, and that Mrs May is the wrong person to lead them into one. She isn''t exactly enthused by the idea either: ''There isn''t going to be a General Election. As far as I''m concerned, the next General Election is 2022. Jeremy Corbyn is trying to engineer an Election but the last thing this country needs is the instability and uncertainty that would produce''.</p><p>Mrs May was delighted when former Chancellor Kenneth Clarke called her a ''bloody difficult woman'', and she celebrates the epithet on her mug. But will she last longer in her office than her hole punch? </p><p>Valiantly, Mrs May said she hoped the deal could be voted through by Christmas so she can enjoy that goose and ''a nice glass of red'' chosen by Philip.</p><p>''I think most people want us to do this, to get it done and get it all wrapped up by Christmas and actually focus on the future,'' she said.</p><p>How will she celebrate, assuming events allow it? ''We like to have a quiet Christmas. We''ll have a couple of friends round on Christmas Day, and the churches in Maidenhead have a lunch for people who would otherwise be on their own and so I go up and have a glass of sherry with them. Then we go home and we have our dinner.''</p><p>The Mays will be sticking to their usual meal. ''It''s always goose I''m afraid, yes. Most people always cook turkey, I always cook goose. With everything else that''s going on it''s tried and tested. I try to do a slightly different recipe every year. I saw one in a magazine the other day''.</p><p>Her devotion to Philip, who she married 38 years ago after meeting at Oxford, is obvious. The tight bond between the pair was forged in extremis when her father, an Oxfordshire vicar, died in a car accident a year after the wedding. Her mother died the following year and she does not have any siblings.</p><p>Mrs May praises Philip''s Christmas present choices, saying he is particularly ''good at handbags; he does pick a good handbag''.</p><p>What is the best present she has got him? ''I think he would look me in the eye and say, ''You, darling!'' ''</p><p>Even Mrs May''s fiercest critics admire her resilience in the face of what must be almost intolerable pressure, combined with official duties such as last weekend''s 14,000-mile round-trip to the G20 summit in Argentina.</p><p>It was former Chancellor Kenneth Clarke who delighted Mrs May by describing her as ''a bloody difficult woman''.</p><p>But surely her husband must worry about the impact of the pressure on the diabetic, 62-year-old Prime Minister. ''He is like any supportive partner is,'' she says. ''He''s there and wants to help.''</p><p>She adds that she never takes out the strain on her staff.

The white-painted cornicing is flaking and a plant seed has taken root, unchallenged, in the brickwork.</p><p>But there is no sign of anything else amiss – certainly no clue to the extraordinary drama played out on Kyverdale Road.</p><p>It was only when Miriam Kliers won a High Court dispute over the rights to the £1.4 million property last month that her disturbing story reached the wider world – and shone a spotlight into one of Britain’s most isolated communities.</p><p>Miriam, it emerged, had fled the home and the ultra-orthodox Hasidic Jewish community in Stamford Hill where she grew up, taking nothing but the clothes she was wearing. It was a rejection of the abuse, she says, that she and women like her suffer routinely.</p><p>Following a three-year legal battle, Miriam, 46, who has four children with her ex- husband Shlomo, was awarded 75 per cent of the property’s worth – £810,000 once debts are paid. But victory has come at a price.</p><p>Speaking to The Mail on Sunday, Miriam provides a troubling insight into the conservative sect. She reveals she often went hungry while living in distressing levels of poverty. She was effectively forced into marriage with a husband who, according to the tenets of their faith, had to devote himself to religious study rather than work while she provided for their family.</p><p>Miriam endured a rigidly controlled existence policed by influential rabbis peddling ideologies which, in her view, bordered on brainwashing. This was a world in which she had to ask for permission to sit GCSE exams, let alone use the internet.</p><p>She was even, she says, coerced into fraud. Deputy judge Murray Rosen QC heard that the couple’s home was bought in the name of Miriam’s brother, Mordechai Schmerler, so the family could claim housing benefit.</p><p>This led Rosen to conclude that tax evasion and housing benefit fraud were ‘on the evidence, common practice’ within the community and a ‘disgraceful illegality’.</p><p>Fighting the case has cost Miriam everything: her family, her parents, and most devastatingly, the affection of her children, two boys, 23 and 21, and two girls, 19 and 11.</p><p>‘I was driven out and they took my family from me,’ she says. ‘It was made clear to me at meetings and through abusive phone calls, that I was not going to be able to have a relationship with my kids, and they succeeded in turning them against me.’ Her life, she adds, was made a ‘living hell’.</p><p>The secretive, socially isolated sect, which maintains its devout traditions even in the most liberal cities in the world, is known for its distinctive clothing of black clothing and wide-brimmed tall hats.</p><p>Miriam’s story echoes the more shocking aspects of new film Disobedience, starring Rachel Weisz as New York-based photographer Ronit, who comes from an ultra-orthodox Jewish family in North London.</p><p>Ronit returns following the death of her rabbi father after being banished and disinherited as punishment for a lesbian relationship she pursued as a teenager. To Miriam, it’s a familiar tale: ‘When you want to live outside the community, they make your life a misery. You lose your children because they are considered the property of the community, but you find yourself ostracised by your family and people you called friends.’</p><p>It is an irony that Hasidic Judaism was designed as a joyful sect. The unusual clothing has its origins in 17th Century Polish-Lithuanian nobility, reflecting a determination to be part of a respectable, land-owning class but also to emphasise the importance of individual character.</p><p>The UK has the largest population of Hasidic Jews in Europe of about 50,000, concentrated mainly in London, Salford, Gateshead and Essex’s Canvey Island. Miriam was born into the faith, the third of ten children, to a housewife mother and father who was a ‘ritual slaughterer’.</p><p>Her life was mapped out – she was expected to marry a fellow believer, or Haredi, and, because contraception was forbidden, to have lots of children. Rules governed her life from what to wear, eat and read to how to dress for sex with a spouse.</p><p>But Miriam wanted an education beyond the basic teachings permitted to women in the faith.</p><p>Books were strictly policed – the chaste tales of Enid Blyton were allowed, while the romantic idealism of Louisa May Alcott’s Little Women was not.</p><p>She managed to go to the local library after promising her mother to read only non-fiction.</p><p>‘Sometimes they would spring a snap search at school, when we were turned out into the playground while the adults inspected our bags,’ Miriam recalls. ‘I was terrified once that I would be shamed because I had a book about Captain Cook in my bag and had not got permission to read it.’</p><p>Home life was a constant battle – her father carried out searches for contraband. ‘I felt under constant surveillance,’ she says. ‘There was no privacy.’ Miriam’s most daring book was about beauty because such things were ‘immodest’. Young Hasidic girls wear their hair strictly short, with long skirts and thick tights, even in oppressive heat.</p><p>‘I was taught from an early age I was a danger to men because I could lead them into sin, so it was my responsibility to be modest,’ she says. ‘I was told if I slipped it could have devastating ramifications for me, but especially the men, and it would be my fault.’</p><p>Ambitions undaunted, she was furious when, having asked her parents’ permission to sit maths and English GCSEs, she was told she would have to pay for the exams herself – impossible because she was not then allowed to work.</p><p>‘My parents had no interest. I was destined to be a good wife and breeder, but I saw how my mother struggled,’ she says. ‘We were so poor she made her own cheese and yogurt. Food was rationed out and I often went hungry. I didn’t want that to be my future.</p><p>‘Such poverty within the large families, encouraged by the rabbis, was not unusual, and most rely on government benefits to survive.’</p><p>The contrast between the teachings of their faith, and the reality of their lives, seemed obvious.</p><p>‘I was taught that there was a big bad world out there and we were safe within an enclave of God’s true followers, that we were on the true path and we were special,’ she says. ‘So I didn’t understand why we were so poor.’ The sect was so socially isolated that, at 17, Miriam was ‘blown away’ by her first taste of the real world after going to work for a local Jewish company. There, for the first time, she met other, more relaxed Jewish people.</p><p>‘One woman even came from Golders Green which was like the Badlands to Hasidic people.’</p><p>Golders Green has a strong and historic Jewish community, but while Orthodox, it is not Hasidic. ‘Though expected to marry, the woman was “dating” which was impossible in the Hasidic community, and seemed like a good idea to me,’ Miriam says.</p><p>‘I had an understanding of romantic love and I was envious.’</p><p>It meant she was dreading the plans being put in place for her arranged marriage. </p><p>This came when, aged 23 in 1995, a cousin arranged a match with Shlomo Kliers, an unemployed Talmudic student, from Israel. Like most men in the sect, he was not expected to work before marriage.</p><p>‘I wasn’t attracted to him but I was lonely and he seemed OK, so I said yes,’ Miriam recalls. ‘He couldn’t even read English and knew very little about the world when we met.</p><p>‘After the wedding he told me that his father was in debt and he only married me because it meant he could move to London.’</p><p>They settled in a rented flat in Stamford Hill, paid for by Miriam’s parents.</p><p>She was pregnant within six months, and had three children in three years.</p><p>She was also the main breadwinner.</p><p>‘It was hard because I was doing different jobs but my husband contributed little to the household expenses. When I complained to the rabbi, I was told it was my job to turn him into a man.</p><p>‘I paid all the bills with the help of benefits and took care of the children. I knew that I couldn’t have another child so quickly. But I had to go to the rabbi to ask permission to take contraception.’</p><p>In 2004, the couple bought the house in Kyverdale Road for £418,000, using £103,800 of Miriam’s savings, while Shlomo contributed £32,900. Miriam later told the court that the cash was ‘disguised’ as a charitable donation – when it was from her wages – to avoid paying tax. The house was put in Miriam’s brother’s name so the pair could claim housing benefit.</p><p>The court later heard she had ‘misgivings’ about this advice but agreed to the alleged fraud because of ‘undue influence’ from a ‘patriarchal body’ which she claimed included her close relatives, community leaders and rabbis.</p><p>Such was the influence of the rabbis that Miriam also had to seek special permission to use the internet. Her passion for learning un-dimmed, she began a degree in psychology through the Open University, hoping to get a job in healthcare. But as her exposure to the outside world increased, so it exposed the hypocrisy of her life.</p><p>‘I felt my life was a lie but I couldn’t share my thoughts with anyone I knew, because when I tried to they just became angry,’ she says. ‘I was struggling to cope in a loveless marriage.’</p><p>Then, in 2008, Miriam met Peter, who is Jewish but not Hasidic, when she worked for a local charity. For the first time she felt the stirring of sexual attraction. ‘It was so good to have someone with whom I could share my thoughts,’ she says. ‘It was not a physical relationship then, but it spurred me to think about making changes in my life.’</p><p>Miriam asked Shlomo for a divorce many times but he refused – according to Jewish law, only a man can divorce a woman. All he would agree to is counselling, so she made the decision to flee with her daughters, then aged 14 and five. All hell broke loose.</p><p>The community cut her off and began a campaign of intimidation.</p><p>‘My parents abandoned me and supported him,’ she says. ‘My father said he was ashamed of me and told my siblings not to offer me help. My mother has not spoken to me and my sons cut me dead.’</p><p>Miriam moved into a rented flat, and tried to hold on to her girls but both ended up returning to their father and the community.</p><p>Meanwhile, Peter found his car tyres slashed, and spyware was discovered on Miriam’s laptop. The couple often felt followed.</p><p>Horrifyingly, they were also visited by police following accusations they had sexually abused the girls – claims which came to nothing. ‘It was a nightmare,’ she says. ‘Even the school, part of the community, joined in by telling social services I was not a good mother. Everyone believed they had to punish me and harass Peter because in their eyes I had sinned.’</p><p>Losing her children was, without doubt, the hardest part.</p><p>‘It hurts not having them in my life,’ she admits. ‘I’ve missed so many important moments.’</p><p>Miriam was granted a Jewish divorce in 2013 and brought the case against Shlomo and her brother three years ago. Her husband still lives in the house with the children.</p><p>Judge Rosen found in Miriam’s favour in April, after concluding her brother had failed to provide evidence to prove the house had been bought with his own money.</p><p>The judge’s remarks about the proliferation of fraud have been denied by community leaders, who described them as ‘offensive’.</p><p>Despite her legal win, Miriam has lost too much to be content. But she is, however, hopeful. ‘I have times when it gets very difficult – a bit like grieving – and I suffer from post-traumatic stress,’ she says. ‘It’s been a long process to try to deprogram myself from 40 years of brainwashing.</p><p>‘I want to raise awareness of what goes on. I know there are many other women trapped in that life looking for a way out. I hope I can show they can break free.’</p>', 'https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6475277/Victim-born-ultra-orthodox-Jewish-community-tells-finally-courage-flee.html');

But there''s growing evidence the fashionable therapy can be harmful', 'Eve Simmons For The Daily Maiil', '<p>Since the age of 13, crippling anxiety has derailed mealtimes for long-term eating disorder sufferer, Maddy Le Bourdon. Now 27, her condition is something she has had medical treatment for, on and off, for more than a decade.</p><p>But 18 months ago, she put her faith in the promise of a relatively new type of psychotherapy: mindfulness. Following her GP’s advice, she downloaded a smartphone app called Headspace, for a ten-minute, daily audio session.</p><p>A soothing voice instructed her to focus on her breathing and let noisy thoughts float by without judgment, as if they were passing traffic. But for Maddy, far from leaving her calmer and less worried, it evoked a disturbing reaction.</p><p>‘I began obsessing over my bloated stomach and the food I’d eaten. For the first time ever, I felt the need to purge,’ she recalls.</p><p>Maddy later tried mindful walking, a mindfulness method in which participants focus on the environment and bodily sensations as they walk. ‘I was suddenly overcome with the urge to run,’ she recalls. ‘I ran for miles to silence the nervous thoughts swimming around my head. My anxiety was heightened for weeks.’</p><p>Mindfulness – a type of psychotherapy based on meditation – is booming in popularity.</p><p>Reconnecting our bodies and minds, the therapy said to increase understanding of how our thoughts influence our emotions and behaviour, and promotes self-esteem.</p><p>Dozens of scientific studies have found it to alleviate symptoms of depression and anxiety, and millions say the practise has transformed their lives for the better.</p><p>One recent meta-analysis of six trials found individuals who received a mindfulness-based therapy were 43 per cent less likely to experience depressive symptoms than those receiving other therapies.</p><p>It’s NHS recommended for treating anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, depression and phobias.</p><p>And you don’t need an appointment with a psychotherapist to do it. There are DIY books, apps, and even spa retreats lasting weeks on end in which guests swap their busy lives for intensive, daily mindfulness activities including meditation and yoga. There is no doubt that mindfulness is a welcome addition to the psychotherapists’ toolbox. Yet, amid the enthusiasm, a growing number of psychological experts are concerned that, far from being a panacea, mindfulness could actually be putting the mental health of thousands of people at risk.</p><p>During a typical mindfulness session, individuals sit in silence with their eyes closed for between ten and 60 minutes, focusing on one thing such as the sensations of breathing in and out.</p><p>When the mind wanders, patients are advised to bring their attention back to the thing they are focusing on. Sessions can be carried out alone, or with the help of a therapist or ‘guide’.</p><p>Studies have shown that mindfulness can improve self-esteem, reduce anxiety and help to manage depression. But leading psychologists warn there could be a dark side, and the therapy can in fact exacerbate or even trigger serious psychiatric illness in some vulnerable individuals.</p><p>Dr Miguel Farias, a psychologist and researcher from Coventry University, says: ‘For about five per cent of people, these practices have a paradoxical effect. It makes them much more anxious, induces panic attacks and even psychosis.’</p><p>According to Dr Farias, more than 20 studies – involving thousands of participants – over the past two decades have demonstrated the potentially damaging effect of mindfulness meditation.</p><p>‘Many people have childhood traumas or underlying mental health problems that may be undiagnosed,’ notes Dr Farias. ‘Being forced to sit alone with their thoughts brings out dark memories which they can’t cope with.’ He believes the adverse effects have been overshadowed by a celebrity-fuelled ‘mindfulness hype’.</p><p>A recent study celebrated mindfulness for reducing war veterans’ symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder – such as flashbacks, intrusive thoughts and night terrors – by 20 per cent.</p><p>But two months after the intervention, soldiers’ symptoms returned and were just as debilitating.</p><p>A 2014 study by researchers at the University of Pittsburgh found a daily, 25-minute mindfulness exercise – similar to that of a popular phone app – actually increased blood levels of the stress hormone cortisol in anxious office workers.</p><p>Yet, in 2015, an all-party parliamentary group advocated the use of mindfulness in British educational, healthcare and criminal justice institutions. And since last year, the Government has funded mindfulness schemes in 200 British primary schools in an effort to combat the crisis in children’s mental health.</p><p>Dr Mark Salter, a consultant psychiatrist in East London, has also witnessed the fallout of mindfulness. He says: ‘Most psychiatric illness, whether diagnosed or undiagnosed, is rooted in trauma. People draw on a wide range of distracting coping mechanisms to deal with these day-to-day,’ he explains.</p><p>‘Mindfulness involves stopping all these mechanisms at once which can become distressing, often inducing severe panic and anxiety.’</p><p>For this reason, the UK’s leading venue, The Oxford Mindfulness Centre, exclude those with suicidal thoughts and psychiatric disorders from treatment.</p><p>Dr Farias believes that, by definition, those accessing mindfulness are more mentally fragile than the general population.</p><p>‘By engaging in this therapy, they are seeking a solution to uncomfortable feelings,’ he notes.</p><p>There is specific, grave concern about the growing popularity of mindfulness retreats: week-long, intensive meditation and ‘switching off’ from the wider world.</p><p>One study found that half of individuals attending a mindfulness retreat felt more depressed, anxious and disorientated than before. One experienced delusions, eventually leading to a suicide attempt.</p><p>Scientists believe the reason mindfulness has this unwanted effect could lie with the brain’s ‘alarm centre’, the amygdala.</p><p>Brain-imaging studies by University of Michigan researchers show mindfulness reduces connectivity between the amygdala and the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex – crucial for emotional processing.This can mean less worry for some, but anxiety and panic for others.</p><p>Dr Farias warns: ‘Without a trained psychological professional, it can be seriously harmful. Mindfulness is not for everyone.’</p><p>Maddy has since found relief in another type of psychotherapy.</p><p>‘I’ve been learning why I need to feed my body properly,’ she says. ‘Trying to stop thinking was never going to help me. Only when I tackled how I saw my body could I fix my relationship with food.’</p><p>between IBS and IBD?</p><p>IBS (irritable bowel syndrome) affects more than ten million people and symptoms include gas, cramps and alternating constipation and diarrhoea. Rarely serious, it’s thought to be down to a body’s response to ‘trigger’ foods. IBD (inflammatory bowel disease) affects about 300,000 and includes Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis – serious illnesses leading to severe inflammation of the bowel. Patients suffer diarrhoea, weight loss and fever. Most end up needing surgery.</p><p>USE ONE PILLOW TO AVOID NECK STRAIN</p><p>Ensuring the neck is in a neutral position and in line with the spine when sleeping is key to avoiding neck strain.</p><p>Marc Sanders, of the British Chiropractic Association, says: ‘Two pillows can cause your neck to excessively bend forward.</p><p>‘But remember, if your one pillow is too thin you may find your neck is bent backwards.</p><p>‘When we adopt these postures during sleep, they can increase stresses on the neck.’</p><p> </p>', 'https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-6474413/The-dark-mindfulness-Growing-evidence-therapy-harmful.html');

In seconds, her mere presence reduced everyone else to bit-part players. Because she is a mega-watt star.</p><p>A part of her power was physical – she looked incredible – big and strong.

Again and again, she talks of how she has been motivated by her desire to ‘prove herself’ – even though with two Ivy League degrees, the oratory of Mark Antony, well-balanced and intelligent daughters, and her superstar husband, she has already achieved more than most people could ever dream of.</p><p>It’s interesting to wonder what she would have been like if she had been born white. If, from her very earliest years, she hadn’t been spurred on by the determination to demonstrate that she could, would and should be a part of a world she felt automatically excluded her. </p><p>If she hadn’t been driven by a sense that she would always have to be more clever and more hard working than a white woman to justify her seat at the table. If she hadn’t viewed the world around her as a combat zone of prejudice and inequality that she had to conquer.</p><p>I hope that last week, as she received a standing ovation on stage, dressed head-to-toe in white, she finally allowed herself to feel what the rest of the world knows to be true: she has, most definitely, proven herself.</p><p>Speaking of inspiring characters, my woman of the year vote goes to 27-year-old Daniela Tejada, right, the wife of Matthew Hedges, the British academic given a life sentence in the United Arab Emirates after being falsely accused of spying.</p><p>Her decision to go public about her husband’s plight would have been a lonely and brave one. No doubt she was being urged by the Foreign Office to keep quiet and let the behind-the-scenes workings of officialdom try and secure his freedom.</p><p>But her action almost certainly hastened his eventual pardon and release by bringing his fate into the court of public opinion and thereby ratcheting up the urgency for the new Foreign Secretary, Jeremy Hunt, to get him out of there.</p><p>I don’t mean to belittle Daniela’s achievement by adding that, under unimaginable emotional pressure, she always appeared beautiful with a composure and articulacy well beyond her years or experience. </p><p>Surely Netflix is at this moment commissioning a film based on the couple’s story.

I mean, there’s no great secret. A lot of administrations make changes after midterms. I will say that, for the most part, I’m very, very happy with this Cabinet.

It’s not his fault. It’s not his strength,'' he asserted.  </p><p>Trump said at ''some point'' the retired marine general ''is going to want to move on.'' He maintained that it is possible that Kelly would stay through 2020 but backed off the initial pledge.</p><p> </p>', 'https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6474853/Trump-confirms-chief-staff-John-Kelly-end-year.html');

''But ... we faced an hour of destiny for the Christian Democratic Union 18 years ago.''</p><p>''We kept a cool head,'' she said. ''We showed everyone.''</p><p>Merkel appealed to the party to show unity, noting that arguments in recent years over migration have showed ''where endless arguments lead.''</p><p>''I wasn''t born as chancellor or as party leader,'' she said.

Could DIY blood tests free you from the GP?', 'Thea Jourdan For The Mail On Sunday', '<p>Worried about diabetes or high cholesterol? Maybe you’re desperate to know why you’re tired all the time?</p><p>Good news… waiting for a GP’s verdict on a host of conditions may no longer be necessary. Over the past five years, the array of do-it-yourself health tests has mushroomed, promising to aid diagnosis of everything from vitamin deficiencies to heart disease. </p><p>With a third of British women neglecting potentially lifesaving screening appointments, the Department of Health may soon roll out DIY smear tests nationwide. Similarly, at-home tests for sexually transmitted infections successfully detect disease and aid early diagnosis. Many DIY tests can deliver a verdict in seconds – but are all these home-test kits as scientific as they should be?</p><p>Will they spark anxiety over a condition you don’t have – or worse, miss one that you do?</p><p>Here we check out a range of the most popular – and get the medical experts’ verdict…</p><p>What is it? A finger-prick blood test that claims to help assess risk of developing heart disease. Higher blood levels of LDL cholesterol, a type of fat, are a known risk factor for coronary heart disease, the UK’s biggest killer.</p><p>How does it work? The test contains a sharp blade called a lancet and a test card. Draw blood using the lancet, then place the blood on the card containing a dye which will change colour. A corresponding instruction indicates what each colour means, providing an instant result.</p><p>The verdict: Doesn’t distinguish between types of cholesterol but, says Dr Louise Selby, a GP based in Guildford, Surrey: ‘It may prompt people with high cholesterol, or heart disease in their family, to visit their GP.’</p><p>What is it? Measures eight chemicals in the blood which indicate thyroid function, iron levels and Vitamin D level. Claims to diagnose deficiency and anaemia.</p><p>How does it work? The blade draws eight to ten drops of blood, placed in a small tube provided. This sample is then sent in a pre-paid sealed envelope to a lab for testing. Results are available within three days.</p><p>The verdict: ‘Results are limited,’ explains Dr Selby. ‘Anaemia is normally diagnosed via a test for the protein haemoglobin in the blood. You can be anaemic and have normal iron levels.’</p><p>What is it? A blood test measuring blood glucose levels and signs of pre-diabetes – when blood sugar levels are too high, but not high enough to indicate type 2 diabetes.</p><p>How does it work? The finger-prick test detects abnormally high levels of HbA1c , or glycated haemoglobin, in the blood. High levels are associated with excess blood glucose and are considered a sign of pre-diabetes. One drop of blood is blotted on to a test strip, which then changes colour in two minutes. Colour-comparison charts indicate the result.</p><p>THE VERDICT: Luci Daniels, a dietician who works with diabetics, says: ‘HbA1c is an accurate way of measuring long-term blood sugar levels but I have not seen evidence that this test does the same as ours do in clinic.’</p><p>What is it? A finger-prick test to measure prostate specific antigen (PSA) in the blood, linked to prostate cancer and prostatitis. Results are seen within ten minutes.</p><p>How does it work? The finger is pricked and blood collected in a plastic measuring chamber. After ten minutes, lines appear in the window of the chamber. Two lines indicate a positive result that warrants further investigation.</p><p>The verdict: Christopher Eden, Urology Professor at Guildford’s Royal Surrey County Hospital, has used these tests with patients. ‘They are 80 per cent as accurate as a lab test and better than no test at all.’</p><p>What is it? A blood test for gluten sensitivity and coeliac disease, an auto-immune condition in which gluten triggers damage to the gut. Delivers results in five minutes.</p><p>How does it work? The test checks for IgA anti-bodies which occur when someone with coeliac disease eats gluten. Blood is drawn and placed in a measuring chamber. A window shows the results – positive if a red line appears.</p><p>the verdict: Dr Selby says: ‘This is how I test for coeliac disease but it is not 100 per cent accurate. The IgA antibodies only build up when gluten is eaten, and many who are coeliac may follow a gluten-free diet. The diagnosis must be confirmed by a doctor.’</p><p>What is it? Screens for the presence of the Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) – which causes cervical cancer.</p><p>How does it work? The kit contains a collecting device, instructions and a plastic wand which a woman inserts into her vagina to collect a swab. The sample is sealed, placed in a pre-paid return box and sent to a laboratory for testing. Results are emailed within ten days.</p><p>The verdict: Dr Selby says: ‘This is not a test for cancer – it’s for a virus that might make you more at risk.’ Researchers found these tests produce more ‘false positives’ (detecting disease when there isn’t any) than GPs’ screening tests.</p><p></p>', 'https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-6474753/Could-DIY-blood-tests-free-GP.html');

or get off the road ''is expected to raise up to SIX times as much as the congestion charge''', 'Joe Middleton For Mailonline', '<p>A new London pollution charge covering large swathes of London is expected to hit one million drivers and raise six times as much as the congestion charge.</p><p>Mayor Sadiq Khan confirmed that ULEZ - being introduced in Central London next year - will stretch to cover an area surrounded by the North and South Circular roads from October 2021.</p><p>The £12.50 per day fee means cash-strapped Transport for London will collect between £700 million and £1.5 billion every year- a significantly higher amount than the £230 million collected from the congestion charge.</p><p>Gareth Bacon, leader of the Conservative group on the London Assembly, told The Times: ''This could be Sadiq''s poll tax.</p><p>''It has flown under the radar and people do not know what is going to hit them.''</p><p>Mr Bacon, even went so far as to reference the current protests in France and that Mr Khan could have his own ''gilets jaunes'' moment once Londoners realise how much they could be paying.</p><p>Mr Khan confirmed the extension of the ULEZ earlier this year after concerns about pollution in the capital.</p><p>The first part of the scheme will start on April 8, 2018, and vehicles driving within the area will need to meet new tighter emissions standards or pay the daily charge to travel. </p><p>It means those driving older vehicles across a major part London – an area 18 times greater than the central zone – will face a £12.50 daily fee if they use their cars.  </p><p>By 2021, owners of petrol cars that are more than 15 years old and diesel vehicles that are more than six years old will have to pay £12.50 to use them in London.</p><p>It is estimated that an additional 100,000 cars, 35,000 vans and 3,000 lorries might be affected by the expanded zone every day.</p><p>But TfL''s own ''integrated impact assessment'' says about 565,000 cars registered in the capital will be liable if driven.</p><p>It also says 276,000 vans registered in London would be affected by it, as well as minicabs and HGVs, taking the total vehicles that could be eligible to one million.</p><p>Khan made the announcement earlier this year at the same time  he launched a new study to measure the impact of air pollution reduction strategies on the health of children in London and Luton.</p><p>Confirmation of the expanded ultra-low emission zone comes after research showed the health damage from cars and vans across the UK costs £6billion a year to the NHS and society, with the bill in London £650million.</p><p>Officials said expanding the ULEZ and stricter standards for heavy vehicles across London would result in more than 100,000 Londoners no longer living in areas exceeding legal air quality limits in 2021 and all areas in the capital are expected to see reductions in pollution.</p><p>Mr Khan previously said: ''Tackling London''s lethal air and safeguarding the health of Londoners requires bold action.</p><p>It''s not just cars and vans that will be subject to extra charges in London.</p><p>These ULEZ non-compliant vehicles will also be impacted:  </p><p>- Motorcycles, mopeds, motorised tricycles, quadricycles</p><p>- 4X4 light utility vehicles and picksups</p><p>- Motorised horseboxes</p><p>- Ambulances and fire engines</p><p>- Motorcaravans</p><p>- Minibuses</p><p>- Lorries</p><p>- Buses and coaches</p><p>- Breakdown & recovery vehicles</p><p>- Snow ploughs and gritters</p><p>- Refuse collection vehicles and road sweepers</p><p>- Concrete mixers and tippers</p><p>''Air pollution is a national health crisis and I refuse to stand back as thousands of Londoners breathe in air so filthy that it shortens our life expectancy, harms our lungs and worsens chronic illness.</p><p>''I promised hard-hitting measures to tackle our shameful air pollution and today City Hall is confirming the next stage of our plans to expand the ultra-low emission zone up to the North and South Circular roads.''</p><p>Nicholas Lyes, RAC roads policy spokesman, previously said the expansion, which will cover huge residential areas within the North and South Circular road, gives very little time for residents and small business owners to purchase vehicles that are compliant with the Mayor''s emission standards.</p><p>''Many now face the daunting challenge of having to spend substantial amounts of money on a newer vehicle or face a daily charge of £12.50 to use their vehicles from October 2021,'' he said.</p><p>''These time pressures and costs will be keenest felt by those from low income backgrounds, as well as those who work in roles such as hospitality and depend on using a car at night when public transport is not readily available.</p><p>''Motorists currently have no quick and easy means of knowing for certain what Euro emissions standard their car, or one they are looking to buy, meets – so it is absolutely vital that a central database is developed as quickly as possible.''</p><p>Mr Khan has been pushing hard for London to spearhead new measures to reduce vehicle emissions in the capital since being sworn in as mayor in 2016.</p><p>This includes the introduction of the T-Charge last year, which will be superseded by ULEZ in 2019.</p>',

From record numbers of women, older workers and those from ethnic minority backgrounds in work, to record low gender and ethnic minority pay gaps.</p><p>There are fewer households where no-one works than ever before, and fewer children growing up in a workless home. Two years on from the Brexit referendum, the UK jobs market is smashing expectations.</p><p>This progress actually matters to people. The prospects of a better future that comes with having a job, knowing that your job is secure, and seeing your wages rise above inflation – as they have in the UK this year.</p><p>One of the 18 records we hit this year was having more people than ever before in full-time work, 23.9 million of them, with almost 2.6 million more than in 2010.</p><p>Any employer knows that creating a new full-time role is a big investment. But with a Conservative Government that is firmly behind business, unlike the anti-business and anti-jobs agenda of Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party, employers have the confidence to make those investments in jobs – over 400,000 in the last year alone.</p><p>If, as a result of the Brexit vote in Parliament next week, MPs create uncertainty about our country’s future direction, suddenly those investments will be harder to make. Or worse, businesses may look to cut back on spending and make redundancies. We may have broken 18 employment records in 2018, but our jobs boost could become a jobs bust.</p><p>No surprise then that employers, large and small, and groups representing business like the Federation of Small Businesses and the Confederation of British Industry, have warned against a no-deal Brexit and backed the Government’s Brexit deal.</p><p>I also back the deal. That is because I, like them, see a compromise that works. Not a no-deal that cuts some of our most important trade links, or a second referendum that would open our divisions even further.</p><p>There are those, including in Parliament, who dismiss the views of business. That is a mistake. Look at another of our 18 records – Private Sector employment at an all-time high of over 27 million, with over 380,000 more jobs in the last year alone.</p><p>More people in the UK work in the private sector than ever before. Those companies support the government’s deal because they know it protects their business, without blocking the possible benefits of Brexit like new trade links.</p><p>Some may see opportunity in chaos, but employers do not. Create uncertainty, push back Brexit, seek to harden it or stop it all together and you risk the stable economy that has delivered so many employment records. A strong economy which Conservatives in government have worked together so hard to deliver.</p><p>It is right that MPs debate Brexit ahead of the big vote and everyone gets a chance to have their say. But on Tuesday, when MPs decide whether to back the deal or not, I hope my colleagues on all sides will listen to the employers of this country and deliver the only deal which gives them the certainty they need to make 2019 another record-breaker.
